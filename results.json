            "text": "It\u2019s been a viciously hot July for much of the planet thanks to heatwaves made worse by climate change. A new study breaks down how much of a role the climate crisis played in bringing on record-shattering temperatures this month.\n\nHuge swathes of the Northern Hemisphere have been sweltering for weeks, with heat domes forming over North America, North Africa, the Mediterranean, and Asia this summer. The first week of July was likely the planet\u2019s hottest week on record, according to preliminary data from the World Meteorological Organization. Temperatures breached 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in North America\u2019s Death Valley and parts of northwest China this month. All-time heat records were also broken in parts of Spain, France, Algeria, and Tunisia.\n\nHuge swathes of the Northern Hemisphere have been sweltering for weeks\n\nThe study published today zooms in on heat spells in the southwest United States, northern Mexico, southern Europe, and the lowlands of China when they were the most severe in July. Heatwaves affecting North America and Europe would have been \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without climate change, says the study conducted by World Weather Attribution (WWA), an international collaboration of researchers. The severe heat spell in China this month was also about 50 times more likely because of global warming. Climate change showed the most influence in Europe, where temperatures were 2.5 degrees Celsius hotter than they would have been without climate change.\n\nThe study authors used peer-reviewed methods to compare real-world temperatures to what they likely would have been without the roughly 1.2 degrees of global warming humans have caused since the Industrial Revolution. Unless the world switches to clean energy, heatwaves are forecast to keep getting more frequent and intense with climate change. Heatwaves like what the world saw in July could take place as often as every couple of years if global warming climbs 2 degrees above the preindustrial era, the study says.\n\nSo while it\u2019s clear that temperatures have reached new extremes this summer, the researchers warn that it\u2019s quickly becoming the new norm. \u201cIt could well be that this is what will be a cool summer in the future if we don\u2019t stop burning fossil fuels,\u201d Friederike Otto, one of the authors of the study and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said in a press briefing yesterday.",

            "text": "It\u2019s surprisingly easy for someone to mess with the makeup of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, regardless of the consequences that could have for our planet. Now, as part of its plans to address security risks posed by climate change, the European Union is calling for talks on a potential international framework on how to treat deliberately atmosphere-altering technologies, AKA geoengineering.\n\nThe idea with geoengineering is to deploy new technologies that might be able to cool the planet down. The tactic that\u2019s caused the most uproar lately is called solar geoengineering, which are basically attempts to manipulate the planet\u2019s ability to reflect sunlight back into space.\n\nThe issue is that scientists aren\u2019t quite sure how much good that would do or whether geoengineering might inadvertently trigger new problems. That\u2019s why the European Commission says the world needs to start thinking about rules on geoengineering. Without them, climate vigilantes could decide to go ahead with their experiments without any oversight or accountability. In fact, that\u2019s already started to happen, albeit on a small scale.\n\n\u201cThese technologies introduce new risks to people and ecosystems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risks, impacts and unintended consequences that these technologies pose are poorly understood, and necessary rules, procedures, and institutions have not been developed. These technologies introduce new risks to people and ecosystems, while they could also increase power imbalances between nations, spark conflicts and raises a myriad of ethical, legal, governance and political issues,\u201d says a joint communication adopted by the European Commission today.\n\nBack in 2010, a de facto moratorium on large-scale geoengineering came out of a United States biodiversity conference. It\u2019s vague, excludes small-scale experiments, and might only apply to initiatives deemed harmful to biodiversity.\n\nThe document says the EU wants to \u201cpromote\u201d new international talks on how to potentially govern geoengineering efforts, as well as \u201csupport\u201d efforts to better understand the risks such experiments could pose. More broadly, the document outlines around 30 different actions the EU plans to take to address security risks posed by climate change, like establishing a data hub on climate and environment security within the EU Satellite Centre.\n\nClimate change itself could technically be thought of as the result of geoengineering. By burning tremendous amounts of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution, humans have released enough greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere to change the climate. Global temperatures are rising, and that\u2019s bringing on more severe storms, droughts, heatwaves, and other disasters.\n\nGeoengineering to counteract global warming, however, could pose new challenges. There still isn\u2019t a lot of research into what exactly the consequences could look like, which is why the EU is calling for it now. Early studies suggest that releasing particles into the atmosphere that reflect sunlight could undo decades of work to repair the ozone hole over Antarctica.\n\nNevertheless, a solar geoengineering startup called Make Sunsets caused a stir after it released several balloons carrying sulfur dioxide over the past year. The reflective sulfur dioxide particles were supposed to mimic the way debris from volcanic eruptions reflect solar radiation. For example, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines lowered the average global temperature by about 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) for a little over a year.\n\nBut sulfur dioxide pollution can also potentially cause acid rain and irritate people\u2019s lungs, and releasing enough of it could worsen the Antarctic ozone hole. Make Sunsets\u2019 experiments were probably way too small to cause any measurable adverse side effects, but it was enough to spook some people.\n\nMexico moved to bar solar geoengineering experiments in January after Make Sunsets launched balloons there without getting any prior consent. Make Sunsets responded to the ban by releasing a few more sulfur dioxide-carrying balloons from Reno, Nevada, in February. The company claimed to have gotten a green light from the FAA, although officials told The Verge they never gave any official approval because it wasn\u2019t required.",

            "title": "Can banks push Bitcoin to clean up its act?",
            "publish_date": "2023-07-11T00:00:00",
            "text": "It\u2019s time for banks and asset managers to start pushing Bitcoin to clean up its pollution, Greenpeace argues in a new report. The environmental organization wants to see Bitcoin change its code to slash energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s a big ask, but Greenpeace argues that financial institutions could have an outsize influence on the Bitcoin network through its business dealings.\n\n\u201cThe report focused on nine major financial institutions that are providing the glue that keeps the Bitcoin ecosystem together,\u201d says Joshua Archer, who leads Greenpeace USA\u2019s Bitcoin campaign. \u201cFinancial institutions have an important responsibility, but they\u2019re currently ignoring the severity of the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report focused on nine major financial institutions that are providing the glue that keeps the Bitcoin ecosystem together\u201d\n\nThose financial institutions \u2014 including BlackRock, Vanguard, JPMorgan Chase, and others \u2014 controlled shares in Bitcoin mining companies that were valued at more than $1.35 billion in April 2023, according to Greenpeace\u2019s report. Many of the financial companies are also expanding their services to make it easier for customers to deal in Bitcoin. That could increase the cryptocurrency\u2019s already hefty environmental footprint, the report says. Crypto companies are facing a storm of scrutiny from regulators after FTX\u2019s spectacular collapse. Democrats are also pressing companies on Bitcoin\u2019s impact on power grids and climate goals. Despite those headwinds, Bitcoin\u2019s emissions can still rise every time its price rallies.\n\nBitcoin is by far the most polluting cryptocurrency. That\u2019s not just because it\u2019s the biggest by market cap but because of the way the blockchain validates transactions. Bitcoin miners run data centers full of specialized machines that solve complex puzzles around the clock. They earn new Bitcoin this way, but all that puzzle-solving comes with energy and environmental costs. The cryptocurrency uses about as much electricity annually as the country of Sweden.\n\nGreenpeace isn\u2019t asking these companies to divest from Bitcoin. Instead, it\u2019s pushing for the blockchain to switch to a new way of validating transactions that gets rid of energy-sucking puzzles. That\u2019s what the second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, did last year \u2014 drastically slashing its energy consumption and emissions in the process.\n\nThere\u2019s been resistance to do the same thing with Bitcoin, though. Miners have already invested in their equipment and would be hard-pressed to throw it all away, for one. And to make the switch, every node on the network would need to be on board. That\u2019s a tough sell for folks who might have bought into Bitcoin in the first place because it\u2019s supposed to be decentralized \u2014 theoretically free from any single institution telling them what to do.\n\nGreenpeace makes the case that financial institutions actually do hold sway. BlackRock is a leader in the pack when it comes to asset managers\u2019 support for Bitcoin, according to the Greenpeace report. Its shareholdings in 18 Bitcoin mining companies were valued at more than $595 million in April. The report also \u201cdraw[s] a direct line from BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin mining investments to the revival of fossil fuel infrastructure.\u201d For example, BlackRock is the biggest institutional shareholder in Greenidge Generation Holdings, a company that uses a previously shuttered gas power plant almost exclusively to mine Bitcoin.\n\nAmong banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the leading Bitcoin supporter, according to the Greenpeace report. It controlled shares in 17 Bitcoin mining companies valued at more than $26 million in April and offers different products and services to help customers invest in Bitcoin. That contradicts the bank\u2019s goal of helping the world reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the Greenpeace report says. And Chase hasn\u2019t been transparent about whether it includes emissions from Bitcoin in its carbon accounting \u2014 a problem for the financial sector overall, Archer says.",

The more water vapor in the air, the less efficiently your sweat can evaporate and carry excess heat away from your skin. That\u2019s why 90 degrees Fahrenheit in humid Miami can feel as bad as 110 in arid Phoenix.\n\nClimate change has supercharged this summer\u2019s exceptionally brutal heat all around the world\u2014heat waves are generally getting more frequent, more intense, and longer. But they are also getting more humid in some regions, which helps extend high temperatures through daytime peaks and into the night. Such relentless, sticky heat is not just uncomfortable, but sometimes deadly, especially for folks with health conditions like cardiovascular disease.\n\nOne of the more counterintuitive effects of climate change is that a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor than a colder one. A lot of it, in fact: Each 1.8 degree Fahrenheit bump of warming adds 7 percent more moisture to the air. Overall, atmospheric water vapor is increasing by 1 to 2 percent per decade. That additional wetness is why we\u2019re already seeing supersize downpours, like the flooding that devastated Vermont earlier this month.\n\nWater vapor is actually a greenhouse gas, like carbon dioxide or methane, responsible for about half of the planet-warming effect. (It's supposed to be up there, whereas humans have been pumping in way too much extra carbon.) More warming evaporates more water, which causes more warming\u2014a climatic feedback loop.\n\nIn landlocked areas, heat waves evaporate water from plants and soils. But humidity gets especially oppressive near the ocean, where water is more readily available. \u201cCoastal regions in general are seeing more humid conditions as ocean temperatures warm,\u201d says Alexander Gershunov, a research meteorologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who studies humidity and heat waves. \u201cAir sitting over a water body tends to be close to saturated. It has a lot of moisture in it\u2014close to 100 percent relative humidity.\u201d\n\nSea surface temperatures have been steadily climbing globally, as the oceans absorb something like 90 percent of the excess heat that humans are adding to the atmosphere. But since March, global sea surface temperatures have been skyrocketing above the norm. The North Atlantic, in particular, remains super hot, loading Europe\u2019s air with extra humidity.",

The advisory panel, which is comprised of airline industry executives, regulators, climate experts, and consumer advocates, will convene on a regular basis to weigh possible changes to the model.\n\nAccording to Google, the panel will \u201cdiscuss and approve updates to the model by incorporating the latest scientific knowledge in the field of flight emissions forecasting.\u201d\n\nGoogle Flights includes emissions estimates based on the Travel Impact Model.

Details like airplane model type, route, speed, and altitude as well as the number of passengers on each flight factor into the model.\n\nTravel booking sites like Google Flights, Expedia, Booking.com, and others use TIM to predict the environmental impact of individual flights in the hopes of helping customers make more sustainable choices. The Travalyst coalition, which includes those groups along with Amadeus, Travelport, Trip.com Group, Tripadvisor, and Visa, has been working with Google on developing TIM.\n\nGoogle\u2019s management of TIM has not been without controversy.

When frozen ground known as permafrost thaws, it creates pools of oxygen-poor water, where microbes chew on organic material and burp methane.

The eggs, made of steel, are tanks brimming with radioactive fluid\u2014contaminated water from Japan\u2019s Fukushima nuclear plant. The water will soon be diluted and pumped into the sea. N\u00faria Casacuberta Arola, of ETH Z\u00fcrich, is among those who will be watching. Closely.\n\n\u201cWe have access to a ship that goes to the coast of Fukushima every year, sometimes once, sometimes twice,\u201d she says. Casacuberta Arola and her colleagues regularly drop an assembly of jars into waters near the incapacitated power plant to collect samples at different depths. The lids of the jars close automatically, one by one, as the device is slowly pulled back up to the surface.\n\nBy doing this, and also taking sediment samples from the seabed, they hope to be able to tell in the coming months and years whether the disposal of water from Fukushima is causing a noticeable rise in radiation in this corner of the Pacific Ocean. The water release could start as early as next month. If there is a significant bump in radiation levels in the surrounding waters, it will mean things have gone very wrong.\n\nIn 2011, a massive tsunami struck Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. The defensive sea wall intended to protect the plant from such an onslaught was many meters too low to stop the monster wave. Seawater flooded the facility, ultimately leading to partial meltdowns and huge explosions at some of the reactors. It is considered one of the worst nuclear accidents in history.\n\nIn the years since, workers have had to constantly pump water into Fukushima\u2019s stricken reactors, which still contain hot nuclear fuel. This water has, thankfully, done its job of keeping the reactors cool, but it has become irradiated in the process, meaning it can\u2019t just be flushed away. Workers have kept the used cooling water on-site, building tank after tank in which to store it. All the while, they have known that they will eventually have to dispose of it. Today, there are 1.3 million metric tons of contaminated water on-site. And no space for any more tanks. The time to do something about it is here.\n\nIt has taken years of research, modeling, and sampling, but earlier this month the International Atomic Energy Agency gave its approval for a discharge plan. Japan\u2019s Nuclear Regulation Authority signed off on the proposals at the same time, meaning that the Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), which is in charge of the plant and its cleanup, has full authority to begin slowly releasing the water into the ocean via a 1-km-long underwater pipe.",

Grace Gibson-Snyder stayed, helping the judge\u2019s scheduling clerk, Farrah Looney, collect the beige and blue cushions that had padded the uncomfortable wooden benches where the plaintiffs sat during the trial.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to help,\u201d said Looney.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d responded Grace, who smiled as she continued collecting cushions, unwilling to leave until she\u2019d done what she could to clean up.\n\nIt was a fitting scene to close the first youth-led climate trial in the United States last week. Held v. Montana was, on its face, about a very specific statutory provision buried in Montana\u2019s Environmental Policy Act that forbids the state\u2019s environmental agency from assessing the climate impacts of fossil fuel extraction within the state. But the central tension of this lawsuit was much larger.\n\nThree years earlier, the plaintiffs filed their complaint against Montana\u2019s entire executive branch, alleging that by prioritizing the permitting of fossil fuel extraction, the state was betraying their right to a \u201cclean and healthful environment\u201d as guaranteed in the state\u2019s constitution. The plaintiffs, ages 5 to 22, argued that even in the face of this global issue, small-scale actions from state governments matter. The state argued the opposite: that if Montana can\u2019t fix the problem of climate change by itself, the courts shouldn\u2019t hold it responsible for redressing a harm it can\u2019t correct on its own.\n\nDespite the state\u2019s best attempts to have the case thrown out, the plaintiffs made it to court, where they sat in front of Judge Kathy Seeley for seven long, disorienting days as the two sides argued about completely different ways of seeing the world.",

            "text": "Some Amazon employees will be forced to relocate to fulfill a company policy requiring three days per week of in-office work, according to sources speaking with Bloomberg. Those affected will include workers hired for remote positions and those who moved during peak pandemic days.\n\nRemote Amazon workers will have to report to \u201cmain hub\u201d offices, including company headquarters in Seattle, New York and San Francisco (and possibly other locations), as The Wall Street Journal reported. However, decisions on who has to relocate, and where, will be decided on a departmental basis. The company reportedly hasn\u2019t yet established how many employees will have to uproot themselves.\n\nAn Amazon representative told Bloomberg today that it observes \u201cmore energy, collaboration, and connections happening\u201d since implementing the in-office mandate, which CEO Andy Jassy announced in February. Some of the company\u2019s workforce viewed the policy as adding insult to injury, as it arrived around the same time as widespread layoffs starting in late 2022 that affected around 27,000 employees. Hundreds of workers staged a walkout in May, protesting the return-to-office policy and the company\u2019s climate shortcomings.\n\n\u201cWe continue to look at the best ways to bring more teams together in the same locations, and we\u2019ll communicate directly with employees as we make decisions that affect them,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson told Bloomberg.",

            "text": "Usually by this time of year, sea surface temperatures\u2014as a global average\u2014drop dramatically. The southern hemisphere has much more water than the northern hemisphere, and it\u2019s now winter there. Yet this year the average remains anomalously high.\n\nYes, the oceans have been getting hotter because of climate change. But something else is going on in the North Atlantic, McNoldy thinks. \u201cWhat we're seeing in 2023 is just so far out of range of what's ever happened,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's not simply a climate change thing. Other recent years aren't like this. It's certainly an ingredient\u2014the overall trend is upward\u2014but from one year to the next, it can go up and down. And this year is just so far up.\u201d\n\nOne possibility has to do with dust from the Sahara\u2014or the lack thereof. Typically at this time of year, east-to-west winds blow across African deserts, loading the atmosphere above the Atlantic with particulates. Dust motes work like innumerable little parasols, bouncing some of the sun\u2019s energy back into space and cooling the ocean. But these winds have been calm recently, clearing the skies above the Atlantic and allowing more energy to heat the water.\n\nAnother has to do with wind: Strong winds that blow across the Atlantic allow it to expel some of its heat. It\u2019s the same evaporative cooling you might have felt after swimming in the ocean, says Shang-Ping Xie, a climate scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who studies the interaction of the atmosphere and the sea: \u201cIf it's windy, you feel chilly.\u201d But right now, the winds are weak, which instead is keeping heat in the Atlantic. \u201cYou basically suppress evaporation from the ocean surface,\u201d Xie says.\n\nScientists are also researching how shipping regulations might be having some effect on the ocean\u2019s temperature. When ships burn fuel with high sulfur content, they produce aerosols that loft into the atmosphere and attract water vapor, brightening clouds. The effect is so dramatic that boats create \u201cship tracks\u201d\u2014white streaks across the ocean that deflect some of the sun\u2019s energy.\n\nOr at least they used to. In 2020, new regulations severely limited the amount of sulfur that ships are allowed to emit. With fewer ship tracks, more solar energy reaches the heavily trafficked North Atlantic. \u201cLess air pollution equals less aerosols, especially those that are more toxic, but also more helpful in cooling the planet,\u201d says Annalisa Bracco, an oceanographer and climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cThe Atlantic is definitively getting less of those, and tends to warm a little more. Aerosols\u2014some, at least\u2014have the same impact of dust.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, aerosols are a tricky problem for climate action. By burning less fossil fuels, humans inject fewer aerosols into the atmosphere. That\u2019s good for protecting human health and slowing climate change. But it tamps down the cooling effect of the aerosols, further raising the temperatures of the oceans and the land.\n\nAll of these uncertainties will play into the fate of this year\u2019s hurricane season. For now, the stage seems set for an epic atmospheric and oceanic battle. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a bit of a competition going on between El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s wind shear and these very warm ocean waters,\u201d says McNoldy. \u201cIt's going to be all about how strong El Ni\u00f1o gets, and how soon it gets strong.\u201d",

This topped a previous record of 80,148 megawatts that was set last July, according to ERCOT data .\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state\u2019s often fragile electric grid has been propped up this year by renewable energy sources, the Texas Tribune reported. Despite overwhelmingly right-leaning leadership and a governor that has echoed climate-denying talking points in the past, Texas has significantly increased solar power generation in recent years. In 2022, the state surprisingly led the country in both wind and solar energy generation. That expansion held up the grid this week during peak energy usage\u2014solar provided almost 20% of power needs on Tuesday before demand peaked .\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday is going to be another scorcher for the lone star state, and another day that will probably strain Texas\u2019 electrical grid. It\u2019s likely that energy usage could peak again this week . ERCOT has said that it will be able to meet energy demand despite the ongoing heat, and the grid is currently seeing normal conditions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexans are definitely going to have to turn up their cooling systems again today. Communities throughout Texas are going to continue to see triple-digit heat indices for several more days, just in time for the Fourth of July weekend. Communities in north Texas, including Dallas and Fort Worth are expected to experience temperatures up to 109 degrees Fahrenheit (42.7 degrees Celsius) with heat indices up to 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. Cities further south in the state are also seeing similar temperatures.\n\n\n\n\u201cA Heat Advisory is in effect for expected heat index values greater than 108 degrees,\u201d the Houston NWS station tweeted today. \u201cSimilar conditions are anticipated for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe heat that\u2019s baked Texas for days now is spreading up and out to the rest of the South. There are excessive heat watches, warnings, and advisories throughout the Southern Rocky Mountains, the Lower Mississippi Valley, and throughout the Gulf states. Tens of millions of Americans are currently under some sort of heat warning or alert, according to Heat.gov.\n\nWant more climate and environment stories?

And they\u2019re doing this with the Seawing\u2014 a 1,000 square meter kite that will fly 300 meters (984 feet) above the water\u2019s surface. So the global shipping industry is apparently rediscovering the joy (and efficiency) of sails.\n\nThe large, ship-sized kite is currently being developed, and the company plans to open a factory to produce the Seawing in 2026. Once manufactured, Airseas has promised that launching and operating a Seawing on a cargo vessel will be automated, making it easy to use for crews. The kite and the equipment that launches it is mounted on a boat\u2019s deck, and the crew can simply press some buttons and a large kite will ascend into the sky. T hat\u2019s not to say that the cargo ships won\u2019t use their engines at all, but the kite will take some pressure off of those engines and will reduce the need for fuel. The wind will move the ship, just like it did for hundreds of years in the ye olden days before industrialization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLowering emissions by 20% may not seem like a big deal, but moving vast amounts of goods to and fro on the high seas creates 3% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s more than the airline industry, which produced about 2% of the world\u2019s emissions in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency.

            "publish_date": "2023-07-10T19:42:50.519000+00:00",
            "text": "Today, I\u2019m talking to Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, the newly created division of Google responsible for AI efforts across the company. Google DeepMind is the result of an internal merger: Google acquired Demis\u2019 DeepMind startup in 2014 and ran it as a separate company inside its parent company, Alphabet, while Google itself had an AI team called Google Brain.\n\nGoogle has been showing off AI demos for years now, but with the explosion of ChatGPT and a renewed threat from Microsoft in search, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made the decision to bring DeepMind into Google itself earlier this year to create\u2026 Google DeepMind.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that Google Brain and DeepMind were not necessarily compatible or even focused on the same things: DeepMind was famous for applying AI to things like games and protein-folding simulations. The AI that beat world champions at Go, the ancient board game? That was DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo. Meanwhile, Google Brain was more focused on what\u2019s come to be the familiar generative AI toolset: large language models for chatbots, editing features in Google Photos, and so on. This was a culture clash and a big structure decision with the goal of being more competitive and faster to market with AI products.\n\nAnd the competition isn\u2019t just OpenAI and Microsoft \u2014 you might have seen a memo from a Google engineer floating around the web recently claiming that Google has no competitive moat in AI because open-source models running on commodity hardware are rapidly evolving and catching up to the tools run by the giants. Demis confirmed that the memo was real but said it was part of Google\u2019s debate culture, and he disagreed with it because he has other ideas about where Google\u2019s competitive edge might come into play.\n\nOf course, we also talked about AI risk and especially artificial general intelligence. Demis is not shy that his goal is building an AGI, and we talked through what risks and regulations should be in place and on what timeline. Demis recently signed onto a 22-word statement about AI risk with OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and others that simply reads, \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d That\u2019s pretty chill, but is that the real risk right now? Or is it just a distraction from other more tangible problems like AI replacing a bunch of labor in various creative industries? We also talked about the new kinds of labor AI is creating \u2014 armies of low-paid taskers classifying data in countries like Kenya and India in order to train AI systems. We just published a big feature on these taskers. I wanted to know if Demis thought these jobs were here to stay or just a temporary side effect of the AI boom.\n\nThis one really hits all the Decoder high points: there\u2019s the big idea of AI, a lot of problems that come with it, an infinite array of complicated decisions to be made, and of course, a gigantic org chart decision in the middle of it all. Demis and I got pretty in the weeds, and I still don\u2019t think we covered it all, so we\u2019ll have to have him back soon.\n\nAlright, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind. Here we go.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity\n\nDemis Hassabis, you are the CEO of Google DeepMind. Welcome to Decoder.\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nI don\u2019t think we have ever had a more perfect Decoder guest. There\u2019s a big idea in AI. It comes with challenges and problems, and then, with you in particular, there\u2019s a gigantic org chart move and a set of high-stakes decisions to be made. I am thrilled that you are here.\n\nGlad to be here.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Google DeepMind itself. Google DeepMind is a new part of Google that is constructed of two existing parts of Google. There was Google Brain, which was the AI team we were familiar with as we covered Google that was run by Jeff Dean. And there was DeepMind, which was your company that you founded. You sold it to Alphabet in 2014. You were outside of Google. It was run as a separate company inside that holding company Alphabet structure until just now. Start at the very beginning. Why were DeepMind and Google Brain separate to begin with?\n\nAs you mentioned, we started DeepMind actually back in 2010, a long time ago now, especially in the age of AI. So that\u2019s sort of like prehistory. Myself and the co-founders, we realized coming from academia and seeing what was going on there, things like deep learning had just been invented. We were big proponents of reinforcement learning. We could see GPUs and other hardware was coming online, that a lot of great progress could be made with a focused effort on general learning systems and also taking some ideas from neuroscience and how the brain works. So we put all those ingredients together back in 2010. We had this thesis we\u2019d make fast progress, and that\u2019s what happened with our initial game systems. And then, we decided in 2014 to join forces with Google at the time because we could see that a lot more compute was going to be needed. Obviously, Google has the most computers and had the most computers in the world. That was the obvious home for us to be able to focus on pushing the research as fast as possible.\n\nSo you were acquired by Google, and then somewhere along the way, Google reoriented itself. They turned into Alphabet, and Google became a division of Alphabet. There are other divisions of Alphabet, and DeepMind was out of it. That\u2019s just the part I want to focus on here at the beginning, because there was what Google was doing with Google Brain, which is a lot of LLM research. I recall, six years ago, Google was showing off LLMs at Google I/O, but DeepMind was focused on winning the game [Go] and protein folding, a very different kind of AI research wholly outside of Google. Why was that outside of Google? Why was that in Alphabet proper?\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here!\n\nThat was part of the agreement as we were acquired was that we would pursue pushing forward research into general AI, or sometimes called AGI, a system that out of the box can operate across a wide range of cognitive tasks and basically has all the cognitive capabilities that humans have.\n\nAnd also using AI to accelerate scientific discovery, that\u2019s one of my personal passions. And that explains projects like AlphaFold that I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to get back to. But also, from the start of DeepMind and actually prior to even DeepMind starting, I believe that games was a perfect testing or proving ground for developing AI algorithms efficiently, quickly, and you can generate a lot of data and the objective functions are very clear: obviously, winning games or maximizing the score. There were a lot of reasons to use games in the early days of AI research, and that was a big part of why we were so successful and why we were able to advance so quickly with things like AlphaGo, the program that beat the world champion at the ancient game of Go.\n\nThose were all really important proof points for the whole field really that these general learning techniques would work. And of course we\u2019ve done a lot of work on deep learning and neural networks as well. And our specialty, I suppose, was combining that with reinforcement learning to allow these systems to actively solve problems and make plans and do things like win games. And in terms of the differences, we always had that remit to push the research agenda and push things, advanced science. And that was very much the focus we were given and very much the focus that I wanted to have. And then, the internal Google AI teams like Google Brain, they had slightly different remits and were a bit closer to product and obviously to the rest of Google and infusing Google with amazing AI technology. And we also had an applied division that was introducing DeepMind technology into Google products, too. But the cultures were quite different, and the remits were quite different.\n\nFrom the outside, the timeline looks like this: everyone\u2019s been working on this for ages, we\u2019ve all been talking about it for ages. It is a topic of conversation for a bunch of nerdy journalists like me, a bunch of researchers, we talk about it in the corner at Google events.\n\nThen ChatGPT is released, not even as a product. I don\u2019t even think Sam [Altman] would call it a great product when it was released, but it was just released, and people could use it. And everyone freaked out, and Microsoft releases Bing based on ChatGPT, and the world goes upside down, and Google reacts by merging DeepMind and Google Brain. That\u2019s what it looks like from the outside. Is that what it felt like from the inside?\n\nThat timeline is correct, but it\u2019s not these direct consequences; it\u2019s more indirect in a sense. So, Google and Alphabet have always run like this. They let many flowers bloom, and I think that\u2019s always been the way that even from Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] from the beginning set up Google. And it served them very well, and it\u2019s allowed them to organically create incredible things and become the amazing company that it is today. On the research side, I think it\u2019s very compatible with doing research, which is another reason we chose Google as our partners back in 2014. I felt they really understood what fundamental and blue sky research was, ambitious research was, and they were going to facilitate us being and enable us to be super ambitious with our research. And you\u2019ve seen the results of that, right?\n\n\u201c...AI has entered a new era.\u201d\n\nBy any measure, AlphaGo, AlphaFold, but more than 20 nature and science papers and so on \u2014 all the normal metrics one would use for really delivering amazing cutting-edge research we were able to do. But in a way, what ChatGPT and the large models and the public reaction to that confirmed is that AI has entered a new era. And by the way, it was a little bit surprising for all of us at the coalface, including OpenAI, how viral that went because \u2014 us and some other startups like Anthropic and OpenAI \u2014 we all had these large language models. They were roughly the same capabilities.\n\nAnd so, it was surprising, not so much what the technology was because we all understood that, but the public\u2019s appetite for that and obviously the buzz that generated. And I think that\u2019s indicative of something we\u2019ve all been feeling for the last, I would say, two, three years, which is these systems are reaching a level of maturity now and sophistication where it can really come out of the research phase and the lab and go into powering incredible next-generation products and experiences and also breakthroughs, things like AlphaFold directly being useful for biologists. And so, to me, this is just indicative of a new phase that AI is in of being practically useful to people in their everyday lives and actually being able to solve really hard real-world problems that really matter, not just the curiosities or fun, like games.\n\nWhen you recognize that shift, then I think that necessitates a change in your approach as to how you\u2019re approaching the research and how much focus you\u2019re having on products and those kinds of things. And I think that\u2019s what we all came to the realization of, which was: now was the time to streamline our AI efforts and focus them more. And the obvious conclusion of that was to do the merger.\n\nI want to just stop there for one second and ask a philosophical question.\n\nSure.\n\nIt feels like the ChatGPT moment that led to this AI explosion this year was really rooted in the AI being able to do something that regular people could do. I want you to write me an email, I want you to write me a screenplay, and maybe the output of the LLM is a C+, but it\u2019s still something I can do. People can see it. I want you to fill out the rest of this photo. That\u2019s something people can imagine doing. Maybe they don\u2019t have the skills to do it, but they can imagine doing it. All the previous AI demos that we have gotten, even yours, AlphaFold, you\u2019re like, this is going to model all the proteins in the world.\n\nBut I can\u2019t do that; a computer should do that. Even a microbiologist might think, \u201cThat is great. I\u2019m very excited that a computer can do that because I\u2019m just looking at how much time it would take us, and there\u2019s no way we could ever do it.\u201d \u201cI want to beat the world champion at Go. I can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s like, fine. A computer can do that.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s this turn where the computer is starting to do things I can do, and they\u2019re not even necessarily the most complicated tasks. Read this webpage and deliver a summary of it to me. But that\u2019s the thing that unlocked everyone\u2019s brain. And I\u2019m wondering why you think the industry didn\u2019t see that turn coming because we\u2019ve been very focused on these very difficult things that people couldn\u2019t do, and it seems like what got everyone is when the computer started doing things people do all the time.\n\nI think that analysis is correct. I think that is why the large language models have really entered the public consciousness because it\u2019s something the average person, that the \u201cJoe Public,\u201d can actually understand and interact with. And, of course, language is core to human intelligence and our everyday lives. I think that does explain why chatbots specifically have gone viral in the way they have. Even though I would say things like AlphaFold, I mean of course I\u2019d be biased in saying this, but I think it\u2019s actually had the most unequivocally biggest beneficial effects so far in AI on the world because if you talk to any biologist or there\u2019s a million biologists now, researchers and medical researchers, have used AlphaFold. I think that\u2019s nearly every biologist in the world. Every Big Pharma company is using it to advance their drug discovery programs. I\u2019ve had multiple, dozens, of Nobel Prize-winner-level biologists and chemists talk to me about how they\u2019re using AlphaFold.\n\nSo a certain set of all the world\u2019s scientists, let\u2019s say, they all know AlphaFold, and it\u2019s affected and massively accelerated their important research work. But of course, the average person in the street doesn\u2019t know what proteins are even and doesn\u2019t know what the importance of those things are for things like drug discovery. Whereas obviously, for a chatbot, everyone can understand, this is incredible. And it\u2019s very visceral to get it to write you a poem or something that everybody can understand and process and measure compared to what they do or are able to do.\n\nIt seems like that is the focus of productized AI: these chatbot-like interfaces or these generative products that are going to make stuff for people, and that\u2019s where the risk has been focused. But even the conversation about risk has escalated because people can now see, \u201cOh, these tools can do stuff.\u201d Did you perceive the same level of scrutiny when you were working on AlphaFold? It doesn\u2019t seem like anyone thought, \u201cOh, AlphaFold\u2019s going to destroy humanity.\u201d\n\nNo, but there was a lot of scrutiny, but again, it was in a very specialized area, right? With renowned experts, and actually, we did talk to over 30 experts in the field, from top biologists to bioethicists to biosecurity people, and actually our partners \u2014 we partnered with the European Bioinformatics Institute to release the AlphaFold database of all the protein structures, and they guided us as well on how this could be safely put out there. So there was a lot of scrutiny, and the overwhelming conclusion from the people we consulted was that the benefits far outweighed any risks. Although we did make some small adjustments based on their feedback about which structures to release. But there was a lot of scrutiny, but again, it\u2019s just in a very expert domain. And just going back to your first question about the generative models, I do think we are right at the beginning of an incredible new era that\u2019s going to play out over the next five, 10 years.\n\nNot only in advancing science with AI but in terms of the types of products we can build to improve people\u2019s everyday lives, billions of people in their everyday lives, and help them to be more efficient and to enrich their lives. And I think what we\u2019re seeing today with these chatbots is literally just scratching the surface. There are a lot more types of AI than generative AI. Generative AI is now the \u201cin\u201d thing, but I think that planning and deep reinforcement learning and problem-solving and reasoning, those kinds of capabilities are going to come back in the next wave after this, along with the current capabilities of the current systems. So I think, in a year or two\u2019s time, if we were to talk again, we are going to be talking about entirely new types of products and experiences and services with never-seen-before capabilities. And I\u2019m very excited about building those things, actually. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m very excited about leading Google DeepMind now in this new era and focusing on building these AI-powered next-generation products.\n\nLet\u2019s stay in the weeds of Google DeepMind itself, for one more turn. Sundar Pichai comes to you and says, \u201cAll right, I\u2019m the CEO of Alphabet and the CEO of Google. I can just make this call. I\u2019m going to bring DeepMind into Google, merge you with Google Brain, you\u2019re going to be the CEO.\u201d How did you react to that prompt?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like that. It was much more of a conversation between the leaders of the various different relevant groups and Sundar about pretty much the inflection point that we\u2019re seeing, the maturity of the systems, what could be possible with those in the product space, and how to improve experiences for our users, our billions of users, and how exciting that might be, and what that all requires in totality. Both the change in focus, a change in the approach to research, the combination of resources that are required, like compute resources. So there was a big collection of factors to take into account that we all discussed as a leadership group, and then, conclusions from that then result in actions, including the merger and also what the plans are then for the next couple of years and what the focus should be of that merged unit.\n\nDo you perceive a difference being a CEO inside of Google versus being a CEO inside of Alphabet?\n\nIt\u2019s still early days, but I think it\u2019s been pretty similar because, although DeepMind was an Alphabet company, it was very unusual for another bet, as they call it an \u201calpha bet,\u201d which is that we already were very closely integrated and collaborating with many of the Google product area teams and groups. We had an applied team at DeepMind whose job it was to translate our research work into features in products by collaborating with the Google product teams. And so, we\u2019ve had hundreds of successful launches already actually over the last few years, just quiet ones behind the scenes. So, in fact, many of the services or devices or systems that you use every day at Google will have some DeepMind technology under the hood as a component. So we already had that integrative structure, and then, of course, what we were famous for was doing the scientific advances and gaming advances, but behind the scenes, there was a lot of bread and butter work going on that was affecting all parts of Google.\n\nWe were different from other bets where they have to make a business outside of Google and become an independent business. That was never the goal or the remit for us, even as an independent bet company. And now, within Google, we\u2019re just more tightly integrated in terms of the product services, and I see that as an advantage because we can actually go deeper and do more exciting and ambitious things in much closer collaboration with these other product teams than we could from outside of Google. But we still retain some latitude to pick the processes and the systems that optimize our mission of producing the most capable and general AI systems in the world.\n\nThere\u2019s been reporting that this is actually a culture clash. You\u2019re now in charge of both. How have you structured the group? How has Google DeepMind structured under you as CEO, and how are you managing that culture integration?\n\nActually, it turns out that the culture\u2019s a lot more similar than perhaps has been reported externally. And in the end, it\u2019s actually been surprisingly smooth and pleasant because you\u2019re talking about two world-class research groups, two of the best AI research organizations in the world, incredible talent on both sides, storied histories. As we were thinking about the merger and planning it, we were looking at some document where we listed the top 10 breakthroughs from each group. And when you take that in totality, it\u2019s like 80\u201390 percent of over the last decade, of the breakthroughs that underpin the modern AI industry, from deep reinforcement learning to transformers, of course. It\u2019s an incredible set of people and talent, and there\u2019s massive respect for both groups on both sides. And there was actually a lot of collaboration on a project-based level ongoing over the last decade.\n\nOf course, we all know each other very well. I just think it\u2019s a question of focus and a bit of coordination across both groups, actually, and more in terms of what are we going to focus on, other places that it makes sense for the two separate teams to collaborate on, and maybe de-duplicate some efforts that basically are overlapping. So fairly obvious stuff, to be honest, but it\u2019s important moving into this new phase now of where we are into more of an engineering phase of AI, and that requires huge resources, both compute, engineering, and other things. And, even as a company the size of Google, we\u2019ve got to pick our bets carefully and be clear about which arrows we are going to put our wood behind and then focus on those and then massively deliver on those things. So I think it\u2019s part of the natural course of evolution as to where we are in the AI journey.\n\nThat thing you talked about, \u201cWe\u2019re going to combine these groups, we\u2019re going to pick what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re going to de-duplicate some efforts.\u201d Those are structure questions. Have you decided on a structure yet, and what do you think that structure will be?\n\nThe structure\u2019s still evolving. We\u2019re only a couple of months into it. We wanted to make sure we didn\u2019t break anything, that it was working. Both teams are incredibly productive, doing super amazing research, but also plugging in to very important product things that are going on. All of that needs to continue.\n\nYou keep saying both teams. Do you think of it as two teams, or are you trying to make one team?\n\nNo, no, for sure it\u2019s one unified team. I like to call it a \u201csuper unit,\u201d and I\u2019m very excited about that. But obviously, we\u2019re still combining that and forming the new culture and forming the new grouping, including the organizational structures. It\u2019s a complex thing \u2014 putting two big research groups together like this. But I think, by the end of the summer, we\u2019ll be a single unified entity, and I think that\u2019ll be very exciting. And we\u2019re already feeling, even a couple of months in, the benefits and the strengths of that with projects like Gemini that you may have heard of, which is our next-generation multimodal large models \u2014 very, very exciting work going on there, combining all the best ideas from across both world-class research groups. It\u2019s pretty impressive to see.\n\nYou have a lot of decisions to make. What you\u2019re describing is a bunch of complicated decisions and then, out in the world, how should we regulate this? Another set of very complicated decisions. You are a chess champion, you are a person who has made games. What is your framework for making decisions? I suspect it is much more rigorous than the other ones I hear about.\n\n\u201cChess is basically decision-making under pressure with an opponent.\u201d\n\nYes, I think it probably is. And I think if you play a game like chess that seriously \u2014 effectively professionally \u2014 since all my childhood, since the age of four, I think it\u2019s very formative for your brain. So I think, in chess, the problem-solving and strategizing, I find it a very useful framework for many things and decision-making. Chess is basically decision-making under pressure with an opponent, and it\u2019s very complex, and I think it\u2019s a great thing. I advocate it being taught at school, part of the school curriculum, because I think it\u2019s a really fantastic training ground for problem-solving and decision-making. But then, I think actually the overarching approach is more of the scientific method.\n\nSo I think all my training is doing my PhDs and postdocs and so on, obviously I did it in neuroscience, so I was learning about the brain, but it also taught me how to do rigorous hypothesis testing and hypothesis generation and then update based on empirical evidence. The whole scientific method as well as the chess planning, both can be translated into the business domain. You have to be smart about how to translate that, you can\u2019t be academic about these things. And often, in the real world, in business, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and hidden information that you don\u2019t know. So, in chess, obviously all the information\u2019s there for you on the board. You can\u2019t just directly translate those skills, but I think, in the background, they can be very helpful if applied in the right way.\n\nHow do you combine those two in some decisions you\u2019ve made?\n\nThere are so many decisions I make every day,it\u2019s hard to come up with one now. But I tend to try and plan out and scenario a plan many, many years in advance. So I tell you the way I try to approach things is, I have an end goal. I\u2019m quite good at imagining things, so that\u2019s a different skill, visualizing or imagining what would a perfect end state look like, whether that\u2019s organizational or it\u2019s product-based or it\u2019s research-based. And then, I work back from the end point and then figure out what all the steps would be required and in what order to make that outcome as likely as possible.\n\nSo that\u2019s a little bit chess-like, right? In the sense of you have some plan that you would like to get to checkmate your opponent, but you\u2019re many moves away from that. So what are the incremental things one must do to improve your position in order to increase the likelihood of that final outcome? And I found that extremely useful to do that search process from the end goal back to the current state that you find yourself in.\n\nLet\u2019s put that next to some products. You said there\u2019s a lot of DeepMind technology and a lot of Google products. The ones that we can all look at are Bard and then your Search Generative Experience. There\u2019s AI in Google Photos and all this stuff, but focused on the LLM moment, it\u2019s Bard and the Search Generative Experience. Those can\u2019t be the end state. They\u2019re not finished. Gemini is coming, and we\u2019ll probably improve both of those, and all that will happen. When you think about the end state of those products, what do you see?\n\nThe AI systems around Google are also not just in the consumer-facing things but also under the hood that you may not realize. So even, for example, one of the things we applied our AI systems to very initially was the cooling systems in Google\u2019s data centers, enormous data centers, and actually reducing the energy they use by nearly 30 percent that the cooling systems use, which is obviously huge if you multiply that by all of the data centers and computers they have there. So there are actually a lot of things under the hood where AI is being used to improve the efficiency of those systems all the time. But you\u2019re right, the current products are not the end state; they\u2019re actually just waypoints. And in the case of chatbots and those kinds of systems, ultimately, they will become these incredible universal personal assistants that you use multiple times during the day for really useful and helpful things across your daily lives.\n\n\u201c...today\u2019s chatbots will look trivial by comparison to I think what\u2019s coming in the next few years.\u201d\n\nFrom what books to read to recommendations on maybe live events and things like that to booking your travel to planning trips for you to assisting you in your everyday work. And I think we\u2019re still far away from that with the current chatbots, and I think we know what\u2019s missing: things like planning and reasoning and memory, and we are working really hard on those things. And I think what you\u2019ll see in maybe a couple of years\u2019 time is today\u2019s chatbots will look trivial by comparison to I think what\u2019s coming in the next few years.\n\nMy background is as a person who\u2019s reported on computers. I think of computers as somewhat modular systems. You look at a phone \u2014 it\u2019s got a screen, it\u2019s got a chip, it\u2019s got a cell antenna, whatever. Should I look at AI systems that way \u2014 there\u2019s an LLM, which is a very convincing human language interface, and behind it might be AlphaFold that\u2019s actually doing the protein folding? Is that how you\u2019re thinking about stitching these things together, or is it a different evolutionary pathway?\n\nActually, there\u2019s a whole branch of research going into what\u2019s called tool use. This is the idea that these large language models or large multimodal models, they\u2019re expert at language, of course, and maybe a few other capabilities, like math and possibly coding. But when you ask them to do something specialized, like fold a protein or play a game of chess or something like this, then actually what they end up doing is calling a tool, which could be another AI system, that then provides the solution or the answer to that particular problem. And then that\u2019s transmitted back to the user via language or pictorially through the central large language model system. So it may be actually invisible to the user because, to the user, it just looks like one big AI system that has many capabilities, but under the hood, it could be that actually the AI system is broken down into smaller ones that have specializations.\n\nAnd I actually think that probably is going to be the next era. The next generation of systems will use those kinds of capabilities. And then you can think of the central system as almost a switch statement that you effectively prompt with language, and it roots your query or your question or whatever it is you\u2019re asking it to the right tool to solve that question for you or provide the solution for you. And then transmit that back in a very understandable way. Again, using through the interface, the best interface really, of natural language.\n\nDoes that process get you closer to an AGI, or does that get you to some maximum state and you got to do something else?\n\nI think that is on the critical path to AGI, and that\u2019s another reason, by the way, I\u2019m very excited about this new role and actually doing more products and things because I actually think the product roadmap from here and the research roadmap from here toward something like AGI or human-level AI is very complementary. The kinds of capabilities one would need to push in order to build those kinds of products that are useful in your everyday life like a universal assistant requires pushing on some of these capabilities, like planning and memory and reasoning, that I think are vital for us to get to AGI. So I actually think there\u2019s a really neat feedback loop now between products and research where they can effectively help each other.\n\nI feel like I had a lot of car CEOs on the show at the beginning of it. I asked all of them, \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to get self-driving cars?\u201d And they all said five years, and they\u2019ve been saying five years for five years, right?\n\nYes.\n\nI\u2019m going to ask you a version of that question about AGI, but I feel like the number has gotten smaller recently with people I\u2019ve talked to. How many years until you think we have AGI?\n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty over how many more breakthroughs are required to get to AGI, big, big breakthroughs \u2014 innovative breakthroughs \u2014 versus just scaling up existing solutions. And I think it very much depends on that in terms of timeframe. Obviously, if there are a lot of breakthroughs still required, those are a lot harder to do and take a lot longer. But right now, I would not be surprised if we approached something like AGI or AGI-like in the next decade.\n\nIn the next decade. All right, I\u2019m going to come back to you in 10 years. We\u2019re going to see if that happens.\n\nSure.\n\nThat\u2019s not a straight line, though. You called it the critical path, that\u2019s not a straight line. There are breakthroughs along the way that might upset the train and send you along a different path, you think.\n\n\u201c...research is never a straight line. If it is, then it\u2019s not real research.\u201d\n\nResearch is never a straight line. If it is, then it\u2019s not real research. If you knew the answer before you started it, then that\u2019s not research. So research and blue sky research at the frontier always has uncertainty around it, and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t really predict timelines with any certainty. But what you can look at is trends, and we can look at the quality of ideas and projects that are being worked on today, look at how they\u2019re progressing. And I think that could go either way over the next five to 10 years where we might asymptote, we might hit a brick wall with current techniques and scaling. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that happened, either: that we may find that just scaling the existing systems resulted in diminishing returns in terms of the performance of the system.\n\nAnd actually, that would then signal some new innovations were really required to make further progress. At the moment, I think nobody knows which regime we\u2019re in. So the answer to that is you have to push on both as hard as possible. So both the scaling and the engineering of existing systems and existing ideas as well as investing heavily into exploratory research directions that you think might deliver innovations that might solve some of the weaknesses in the current systems. And that\u2019s one advantage of being a large research organization with a lot of resources is we can bet on both of those things maximally, both of those directions. In a way, I\u2019m agnostic to that question of \u201cdo we need more breakthroughs or will existing systems just scale all the way?\u201d My view is it\u2019s an empirical question, and one should push both as hard as possible. And then the results will speak for themselves.\n\nThis is a real tension. When you were at DeepMind in Alphabet and you were very research-focused, and then the research was moved back into Google and Google\u2019s engineers would turn it into products. And you can see how that relationship worked. Now, you\u2019re inside of Google. Google is under a lot of pressure as a company to win this battle. And those are product concerns. Those are \u201cMake it real for people and go win in the market.\u201d There\u2019s a leaked memo that went around. It was purportedly from inside Google. It said the company had no moat and open-source AI models or leaked models would run on people\u2019s laptops, and they would outpace the company because the history of open computing would outpace a closed-source competitor. Was that memo real?\n\n\u201cI think that memo was real.\u201d\n\nI think that memo was real. I think engineers at Google often write various documents, and sometimes they get leaked and go viral. I think that\u2019s just a thing that happens, but I wouldn\u2019t take it too seriously. These are just opinions. I think it\u2019s interesting to listen to them, and then you\u2019ve got to chart your own course. And I haven\u2019t read that specific memo in detail, but I disagree with the conclusions from that. And I think there\u2019s obviously open source and publishing, and we\u2019ve done tons of that in the history of DeepMind. I mean, AlphaFold was open sourced, right? So we obviously believe in open source and supporting research and open research. That\u2019s a key thing of the scientific discourse, which we\u2019ve been a huge part of. And so is Google, of course, publishing transformers and other things. And TensorFlow and you look at all the things we\u2019ve done.\n\nWe do a huge amount in that space. But I also think there are other considerations that need to be had as well. Obviously commercial ones but also safety questions about access to these very powerful systems. What if bad actors can access it? Who maybe aren\u2019t that technical, so they couldn\u2019t have built it themselves, but they can certainly reconfigure a system that is out there? What do you do about those things? And I think that\u2019s been quite theoretical till now, but I think that that is really important from here all the way to AGI as these systems become more general, more sophisticated, more powerful. That question is going to be very important about how does one stop bad actors just using these systems for things they weren\u2019t intended for but for malicious purposes.\n\nThat\u2019s something we need to increasingly come up with, but just back to your question, look at the history of what Google and DeepMind have done in terms of coming up with new innovations and breakthroughs and multiple, multiple breakthroughs over the last decade or more. And I would bet on us, and I\u2019m certainly very confident that that will continue and actually be even more true over the next decade in terms of us producing the next key breakthroughs just like we did in the past.\n\nDo you think that\u2019s the moat: we invented most of this stuff, so we\u2019re going to invent most of the next stuff?\n\nI don\u2019t really think about it as moats, but I\u2019m an incredibly competitive person. That\u2019s maybe another thing I got from chess, and many researchers are. Of course, they\u2019re doing it to discover knowledge, and ultimately, that\u2019s what we are here for is to improve the human condition. But also, we want to be first to do these things and do them responsibly and boldly. We have some of the world\u2019s best researchers. I think we have the biggest collection of great researchers in the world, anywhere in the world, and an incredible track record. And there\u2019s no reason why that shouldn\u2019t continue in the future. And in fact, I think with our new organization and environment might be conducive to even more and faster-paced breakthroughs than we\u2019ve done in the past.\n\nYou\u2019re leading me toward risk and regulation. I want to talk about that, but I want to start in with just a different spin on it. You\u2019re talking about all the work that has to be done. You\u2019re talking about deep mind reinforcement learning, how that works. We ran a gigantic cover story in collaboration with New York Magazine about the taskers who are actually doing the training, who are actually labeling the data. There\u2019s a lot of labor conversation with AI along the way. Hollywood writers are on strike right now because they don\u2019t want ChatGPT to write a bunch of scripts. I think that\u2019s appropriate.\n\nBut then there\u2019s a new class of labor that\u2019s being developed where a bunch of people around the world are sitting in front of computers and saying, \u201cYep, that\u2019s a stop sign. No, that\u2019s not a stop sign. Yep, that\u2019s clothes you can wear. No, that\u2019s not clothes you can wear.\u201d Is that a forever state? Is that just a new class of work that needs to be done for these systems to operate? Or does that come to an end?\n\nI think it\u2019s hard to say. I think it\u2019s definitely a moment in time and the current systems and what they\u2019re requiring at the moment. We\u2019ve been very careful just to say, from our part, and I think you quoted some of our researchers in that article, to be very careful to pay living wages and be very responsible about how we do that kind of work and which partners we use. And we also use internal teams as well. So actually, I\u2019m very proud of how responsible we\u2019ve been on that type of work. But going forward, I think there may be ways that these systems, especially once you have millions and millions of users, effectively can bootstrap themselves. Or one could imagine AI systems that are capable of actually conversing with themselves or critiquing themselves.\n\nThis would be a bit like turning language systems into a game-like setting, which of course we\u2019re very expert in and we\u2019ve been thinking about where these reinforcement learning systems, different versions of them, can actually rate each other in some way. And it may not be as good as a human rater, but it\u2019s actually a useful way to do some of the bread and butter rating and then maybe just calibrate it by checking those ratings with a human rater at the end, rather than getting human raters to rate everything. So I think there are lots of innovations I can see coming down the line that will help with this and potentially mean that there\u2019s less requirement for this all to be done by human raters.\n\nBut you think there are always human raters in the mix? Even as you get closer to AGI, it seems like you need someone to tell the computer if it\u2019s doing a good job or not.\n\nLet\u2019s take AlphaZero as an example, our general games playing system that ended up learning, itself, how to play any two-player game, including chess and Go. And it\u2019s interesting. What happened there is we set up the system so that it could play against itself tens of millions of times. So, in fact, it built up its own knowledge base. It started from random, played itself, bootstrapped itself, trained better versions of itself, and played those off each other in sort of mini-tournaments. But at the end, you still want to test it against the human world champion or something like this or an external computer program that was built in a conventional way so that you can just calibrate your own metrics, which are telling you these systems are improving according to these objectives or these metrics.\n\nBut you don\u2019t know for sure until you calibrate it with an external benchmark or measure. And depending on what that is, a human rater or human benchmark \u2014 a human expert is often the best thing to calibrate your internal testing against. And you make sure that your internal tests are actually mapping reality. And again, that\u2019s something quite exciting about products for researchers because, when you put your research into products and millions of people are using it every day, that\u2019s when you get real-world feedback, and there\u2019s no way around that, right? That\u2019s the reality, and that\u2019s the best test of any theories or any system that you\u2019ve built.\n\nDo you think that work is rewarding or appropriate, the labeling of data for AI systems? There\u2019s just something about that, which is, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell a computer how to understand the world so that it might go off in the future and displace other people.\u201d There\u2019s a loop in there that seems like it\u2019s worth more just moral or philosophical consideration. Have you spent time thinking about that?\n\nYeah, I do think about that. I think I don\u2019t really see it like that. I think that what raters are doing is they\u2019re part of the development cycle of making these systems safer, more useful for everybody, and more helpful and more reliable. So I think it\u2019s a critical component. In many industries, we have safety testing of technologies and products. Today, that\u2019s the best we can do for AI systems is to have human raters. I think, in the future, the next few years, I think we need a lot more research. And I\u2019ve been calling for this, and we are doing this ourselves, but it needs more than just one organization to do this, is great, robust evaluation benchmarks for capabilities so that we know if a system passes these benchmarks, then it has certain properties, and it\u2019s safe and it\u2019s reliable in these particular ways.\n\nAnd right now, I think we are in the space of many researchers in academia and civil society and elsewhere, we have a lot of good suggestions for what those tests could be, but I don\u2019t think they are robust or practical yet. I think they\u2019re basically theoretical and philosophical in nature, and I think they need to be made practical so that we can measure our systems empirically against those tests and then that gives us some assurances about how the system will perform. And I think once we have those, then the need for this human rating testing feedback will be reduced. I just think that\u2019s required in the volumes that\u2019s required now because we don\u2019t have these kinds of independent benchmarks yet. Partly because we haven\u2019t rigorously defined what those properties are. I mean, it\u2019s almost a neuroscience and psychology and philosophy area as well, right? A lot of these terms have not been defined properly, even for the human brain.\n\nYou\u2019ve signed a letter from the Center for AI Safety \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and others have also signed this letter \u2014 that warns against the risk from AI. And yet, you\u2019re pushing on, Google\u2019s in the market, you\u2019ve got to win, you\u2019ve described yourself as competitive. There\u2019s a tension there: needing to win in the market with products and \u201cOh boy, please regulate us because raw capitalism will drive us off the cliff with AI if we don\u2019t stop it in some way.\u201d How do you balance that risk?\n\nIt is a tension. It\u2019s a creative tension. What we like to say at Google is we want to be bold and responsible, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do and live out and role model. So the bold part is being brave and optimistic about the benefits, the amazing benefits, incredible benefits, AI can bring to the world and to help humanity with our biggest challenges, whether that\u2019s disease or climate or sustainability. AI has a huge part to play in helping our scientists and medical experts solve those problems. And we\u2019re working hard on that and all those areas. And AlphaFold, again, I\u2019d point to as a poster child for that, what we want to do there. So that\u2019s the bold part. And then, the responsible bit is to make sure we do that as thoughtfully as possible with as much foresight as possible ahead of time.\n\nTry and anticipate what the issues might be if one was successful ahead of time. Not in hindsight, and perhaps this happened with social media, for example, where it is this incredible growth story. Obviously, it\u2019s done a lot of good in the world, but then it turns out 15 years later we realize there are some unintended consequences as well to those types of systems. And I would like to chart a different path with AI. And I think it\u2019s such a profound and important and powerful technology. I think we have to do that with something as potentially as transformative as AI. And it doesn\u2019t mean no mistakes will be made. It\u2019s very new, anything new, you can\u2019t predict everything ahead of time, but I think we can try and do the best job we can.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very new. You can\u2019t predict everything ahead of time, but I think we can try and do the best job we can.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what signing that letter was for was just to point out that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely, I don\u2019t know on the timescales, but it\u2019s something that we should consider, too, in the limit is what these systems can do and might be able to do as we get closer to AGI. We are nowhere near that now. So this is not a question of today\u2019s technologies or even the next few years\u2019, but at some point, and given the technology\u2019s accelerating very fast, we will need to think about those questions, and we don\u2019t want to be thinking about them on the eve of them happening. We need to use the time now, the next five, 10, whatever it is, years, to do the research and to do the analysis and to engage with various stakeholders, civil society, academia, government, to figure out, as this stuff is developing very rapidly, what the best way is of making sure we maximize the benefits and minimize any risks.\n\nAnd that includes mostly, at this stage, doing more research into these areas, like coming up with better evaluations and benchmarks to rigorously test the capabilities of these frontier systems.\n\nYou talked about tool usage for AI models, you ask an LLM to do something, it goes off and asks AlphaFold to fold the protein for you. Combining systems like that, integrating systems like that, historically that\u2019s where emergent behaviors appear, things you couldn\u2019t have predicted start happening. Are you worried about that? There\u2019s not a rigorous way to test that.\n\nRight, exactly. I think that\u2019s exactly the sort of thing we should be researching and thinking about ahead of time is: as tool use becomes more sophisticated and you can combine different AI systems together in different ways, there is scope for emergent behavior. Of course, that emergent behavior may be very desirable and be extremely useful, but it could also potentially be harmful in the wrong hands and in the hands of bad actors, whether that\u2019s individuals or even nation-states.\n\nLet\u2019s say the United States and the EU and China all agree on some framework to regulate AI, and then North Korea or Iran says, \u201cFuck it, no rules.\u201d And that becomes a center of bad actor AI research. How does that play out? Do you foresee a world in which that\u2019s possible?\n\nYeah, I think that is a possible world. This is why I\u2019ve been talking to governments \u2014 UK, US mostly, but also EU \u2014 on I think whatever regulations or guardrails or whatever that is that transpires over the next few years, and tests. They ideally would be international, and there would be international cooperation around those safeguards and international agreement around deployment of these systems and other things. Now, I don\u2019t know how likely that is given the geopolitical tensions around the world, but that is by far the best state. And I think what we should be aiming for if we can.\n\nIf the government here passes a rule. It says, \u201cHere\u2019s what Google is allowed to do, here\u2019s what Microsoft is allowed to do. You are in charge, you are accountable.\u201d And you can go say, \u201cAll right, we\u2019re just not running this code in our data center. We are not going to have these capabilities; it\u2019s not legal.\u201d If I\u2019m just a person with a MacBook, would you accept some limitation on what a MacBook could do because the threat from AI is so scary? That\u2019s the thing I worry about. Practically, if you have open-source models and people are going to use them for weird things, are we going to tell Intel to restrict what its chips can do? How would we implement that such that it actually affects everyone? And not just, we\u2019re going to throw Demis in jail if Google does stuff we don\u2019t like.\n\nI think those are the big questions that are being debated right now. And I do worry about that. On the one hand, there are a lot of benefits of open-sourcing and accelerating scientific discourse and lots of advances happen there and it gives access to many developers. On the other hand, there could be some negative consequences with that if there are bad individual actors that do bad things with that access and that proliferates. And I think that\u2019s a question for the next few years that will need to be resolved. Because right now, I think it\u2019s okay because the systems are not that sophisticated or that powerful and therefore not that risky.\n\nBut I think, as systems increase in their power and generality, the access question will need to be thought about from government and how they want to restrict that or control that or monitor that is going to be an important question. I don\u2019t have any answers for you because I think this is a societal question actually that requires stakeholders from right across society to come together and weigh up the benefits with the risks there.\n\nGoogle\u2019s own work, you said we\u2019re not there yet, but Google\u2019s own work in AI certainly had some controversy associated with this around responsibility, around what the models can do or can\u2019t do. There\u2019s a famous \u201cStochastic Parrots\u201d paper from Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell that led to a lot of controversy inside of Google. It led to them leaving. Did you read that paper and think, \u201cOkay, this is correct. LLMs are going to lie to people and Google will be responsible for that\u201d? And how do you think about that now with all of the scrutiny?\n\nYeah, look, the large language models, and I think this is one reason that Google\u2019s been very responsible with this, is that we know that they hallucinate and they can be inaccurate. And that\u2019s one of the key areas that has to be improved over the next few years is factuality and grounding and making sure that they don\u2019t spread disinformation, these kinds of things. And that\u2019s very much top of mind for us. And we have many ideas of how to improve that. And our old DeepMind\u2019s Sparrow language model, which we published a couple of years ago, was an experiment into just how good can we get factuality and rules adherence in these systems. And turns out, we can maybe make it an order of magnitude better, but it sometimes comes at the expense of lucidness or creativity on the part of the language model and therefore usefulness.\n\nSo it\u2019s a bit of a Pareto frontier where, if you improve one dimension, you reduce the capability in another dimension. And ideally, what we want to do in the next phases and the next generations of systems is combine the best of both worlds \u2014 keep the creativity and lucidness and funness of the current systems but improve their factuality and reliability. And we\u2019ve got a long way to go on that. But I can see things improving, and I don\u2019t see any theoretical reason why these systems can\u2019t get to extremely high levels of accuracy and reliability in the next few years.\n\nWhen you\u2019re using the Google Search Generative Experience, do you believe what it says?\n\nI do. I sometimes double-check things, especially in the scientific domain where I\u2019ve had very funny situations where, actually all of these models do this, where you ask them to summarize an area of research, which I think would be super useful if they could do that, and then say, \u201cWell, what are the key papers I should read?\u201d And they come up with very plausible sounding papers with very plausible author lists. But then, when you go and look into it, it turns out that they\u2019re just like the most famous people in that field or the titles from two different papers combined together. But of course, they\u2019re extremely plausible as a collection of words. And I think, there what needs to happen is these systems need to understand that citations and papers and author lists are a unitary block rather than a word-by-word prediction.\n\nThere are interesting cases like that where we need to improve, and there\u2019s something which is, of course, us as wanting to advance the frontiers of science, that\u2019s a particularly interesting use case that we would like to improve and fix \u2014 for our own needs as well. I\u2019d love these systems to better summarize for me \u201chere are the top five papers to read about a particular disease\u201d or something like that to just quickly onboard you in that particular area. I think it would be incredibly useful.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you, I googled my friend John Gruber, and SGE confidently told me that he pioneered the use of a Mac in newspapers and invented WebKit. I don\u2019t know where that came from. Is there a quality level, a truthfulness level that you need to hit before you roll that out to the mass audience?\n\nYeah, we think about this all the time, especially at Google because of the incredibly high standards Google holds itself to on things like search and that we all rely on every day and every moment of every day, really, and we want to get toward that level of reliability. Obviously, we\u2019re a long, long, long way away from that at the moment with not just us but anybody with their generative systems. But that\u2019s the gold standard. And actually, things like tool use can come in very handy here where you could, in effect, build these systems so that they fact-check themselves, perhaps even using search or other reliable sources, cross-reference, just like a good researcher would, cross-reference your facts. Also having a better understanding of the world. What are research papers? What entities are they?\n\nSo these systems need to have a better understanding of the media they\u2019re dealing with. And maybe also give these systems the ability to reason and plan because then they could potentially turn that on their own outputs and critique themselves. And again, this is something we have a lot of experience in in games programs. They don\u2019t just output the first move that you think of in chess or Go. You actually plan and do some search around that and then back up. And sometimes they change their minds and switch to a better move. And you could imagine some process like that with words and language as well.\n\nThere\u2019s the concept of model collapse. That we\u2019re going to train LLMs on LLM-generated data, and that\u2019s going to go into a circle. When you talk about cross-referencing facts, and I think about Google \u2014 Google going out in the web and trying to cross-reference a bunch of stuff but maybe all that stuff has been generated by LLMs that were hallucinating in 2023. How do you guard against that?\n\nWe are working on some pretty cool solutions to that. I think the answer is, and this is an answer to deepfakes as well, is to do some encrypted watermarking, sophisticated watermarking, that can\u2019t be removed easily or at all, and it\u2019s probably built into the generative models themselves, so it\u2019s part of the generative process. We hope to release that and maybe provide it to third parties as well as a generic solution. But I think that the industry in the field needs those types of solutions where we can mark generated media, be that images, audio, perhaps even text with some Kitemark that says to the user and future AI systems that these were AI-generated. And I think that\u2019s a very, very pressing need right now for near-term issues with AI like deepfakes and disinformation and so on. But I actually think a solution is on the horizon now.\n\nI had Microsoft CTO and EVP of AI Kevin Scott on the show a few weeks ago. He said something very similar. I promised him that we would do a one-hour episode on metadata. So you\u2019re coming for that one. If I know this audience, a full hour on metadata ideas will be our most popular episode ever.\n\nOkay, sounds perfect.\n\nDemis, thank you so much for coming on Decoder. You have to come back soon.\n\nThanks so much.",

REUTERS/Yara Nardi/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nJuly 3 (Reuters) - Italy has sent its revised energy and climate plan to Brussels indicating it will need to invest more and step up efforts to meet a European Union 2030 target for lower carbon emissions.\n\nThe document prepared by the energy ministry and seen by Reuters said that the country's coal-fired power plants will be shut by 2025, except in Sardinia.\n\nThe government will hold talks with the European Commission aimed at reaching a binding version of the plan by June 2024.\n\nBelow are the key 2030 targets indicated by Italy in the document submitted to Brussels:\n\nREDUCTION IN CO2 EMISSIONS\n\n*** In the ESR sectors - transport, housing, agriculture, waste, services and the energy-light industries - Italy expects to cut emissions by 35-37% versus 43.7% required by the European Union.\n\n*** In the ETS sectors - power and energy-intensive industry - Italy expects to cut emissions by 62%, in line with the EU goal.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\n*** Final energy consumption: 100 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) versus 94.4 MTOE required by the EU.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES\n\n*** Italy sees renewables covering 40% of total energy consumption (30% in previous plan presented in 2020).\n\n*** Italy sees renewables covering 65% of electricity production(55% in 2020 plan).\n\n*** Heating and air conditioning from renewable sources: 37% (34% in previous plan).\n\n*** Energy from renewable sources in the transport sector: 31% (17% in previous plan).\n\n*** Hydrogen produced without carbon emissions: 42% (0% in previous targets).

            "text": "The seaside town of Whitehaven, in the north-west of England, found itself at the centre of a political storm in May, when the levelling up, housing and communities secretary, Michael Gove, gave his approval for the UK\u2019s first new deep coalmine in more than 40 years just outside the town.\n\nBut Whitehaven may soon be known for more than climate-wrecking coal. That is the ambition of Project Collette, a \u00a33bn proposal for a windfarm off the Cumbrian coast to be part-owned by the local community \u2013 instigated by the Green Finance Community Hub in collaboration with the engineering firm Arup and community energy specialists Energy4All \u2013 and with the potential to power nearby industry. If Cumbrians could stand on the sandstone cliffs and look out at wind turbines they owned, and that had provided jobs for local people, that might just build the political support and engagement that is so vital to reaching our climate targets?\n\nPeople worry about the climate crisis. It regularly features in opinion polls covering respondents\u2019 top concerns. But in more in-depth discussions with people, my research team at Lancaster University have discovered a vicious circle at play. The more people learn about the scale and urgency of the climate crisis, the more they look to the government for leadership. Yet they tell us they don\u2019t have confidence that the government will provide that leadership. There is a danger that people fall into a fatalism trap: it\u2019s too big for me alone, they say, and yet I don\u2019t believe politicians will step up.\n\nThere is a route out of this trap. Politicians need to put forward bold policies for the climate that link to people\u2019s aspirations and provide tangible benefits, such as local jobs. If they did that, our research suggests that people would both reward them and step up to the mark themselves to work toward local solutions.\n\nThat\u2019s where ventures such as Project Collette come in. Imagine increasing the supply of zero-carbon electricity through solar farms and wind turbines that are part-owned by local people or local councils. Green jobs would no longer be something dreamed up by Westminster thinktanks, but tangible, visible schemes employing you or your neighbour. The locally owned profits could be invested in local priorities, like insulation schemes for all homes and improved green spaces.\n\nLocally controlled renewables would also help ease people\u2019s concerns about nearby developments. A strong majority of the population supports wind power and other renewables. But research indicates that people\u2019s support does not only depend on whether they like the look of the technology, but on whether they have a say in planning local schemes, and who they think is benefiting from the project.\n\nThis vision is a stark contrast to how the energy sector is run at the moment, dominated as it is by commercial energy companies with distant headquarters. Under our hyper-liberalised market, community involvement is just about possible \u2013 if you are very determined. The UK\u2019s first community-owned windfarm, Baywind, was built more than 25 years ago in 1997, just down the coast from Whitehaven. More recently, Bristol city council backed a successful proposal to build another community-led wind project in deprived Lawrence Weston.\n\nBut it\u2019s unbelievably difficult for non-profits to navigate the treacherous route through the planning system, financing and complex regulatory requirements. As a result, examples such as the above are the exception, not the rule. They make up a tiny fraction of total output. Under the current system, Project Collette may never be more than a pipe dream.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising, then, that the Labour party has seized on the need for reform. When Keir Starmer launched his climate plans in June, buried beneath the headline policies was an intriguing \u201clocal power plan\u201d that would make initiatives like Project Collette mainstream. Under its proposals, the publicly owned GB Energy would partner with communities and private developers to finance local energy projects, with communities owning a share and the profits ploughed back.\n\nThis should have broad cross-party support. Back in 2014, at the request of Ed Davey, then a minister in the coalition government, I co-chaired a taskforce looking into how the government could encourage, or require, commercial companies to offer a share in ownership to local people. We developed a good plan that the government accepted as part of a wider package of support for community energy. But events, not least the 2015 election, the backbench Conservative rebellion against windfarms and then the Brexit wranglings, overtook us, and the opportunity was lost. Since then, such community projects have stalled.\n\nWhat better way for any government to demonstrate that it is putting its trust in people than giving them a direct say in decision-making? In 2020, the UK parliament\u2019s own climate assembly proved the value of involving citizens in developing plans for net zero. Brussels and Milan now have their own permanent citizens\u2019 assemblies to help take decisions on climate. The UK could be the first country to create a permanent assembly to advise on net zero, as part of wider plans for constitutional reform.\n\nTo the people of Whitehaven, net zero, not to mention green jobs, seem like distant, abstract concepts, compared with the very tangible, if controversial, offer of jobs in coal mining. If we are to maintain and build political and public support for climate action, we need to focus on interventions that benefit people and place. I look forward to standing on those Cumbrian cliffs and seeing the turbines of Project Collette turning in the steady sea breeze.",

Three of the sources said Brussels had considered a partial exit that would let some countries stay in the treaty, but opted against it over legal concerns.\n\nPressure has mounted on Brussels to lead an EU-wide exit after Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain announced they planned to quit the treaty. Italy left in 2016.\n\nBut the proposal is likely to be opposed by countries including Cyprus, Hungary and Slovakia, which have said they would prefer to stay in an updated version of the accord.\n\nAny proposal will need backing from a reinforced majority of member states and support from the European Parliament, which has publicly backed the idea.\n\n\"A coordinated withdrawal would remove one of the main obstacles to realising the EU's binding climate targets,\" said Lukas Schaugg, an analyst at the International Institute for Sustainable Development think tank.\n\nTreaty signatories last year negotiated reforms designed to address some of the climate concerns, but which received a mixed reception from EU countries and criticism from campaigners. The reforms would struggle to pass without EU support.\n\nThe unreformed treaty has a \"sunset clause\" that would protect existing fossil fuel investments in Europe for 20 years even after the EU quit. The reformed version would let the EU shorten that to 10 years.\n\nReporting by Kate Abnett; editing by Barbara Lewis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "text": "Climate campaigners have condemned as \u201ccynical\u201d suggestions by the boss of the energy company Shell that cutting the world\u2019s oil and gas production would be dangerous and irresponsible.\n\nWael Sawan claimed in an interview that reducing fossil fuel production, which is considered crucial in limiting the rise in global temperatures, risked worsening the cost of living crisis by limiting global energy supplies and pushing up bills.\n\nThe Shell chief executive, who took up the post last September, also argued that poorer countries would bear the brunt of a gas shortfall if they were unable to compete for shipments on the global market.\n\n\u201cWhat would be dangerous and irresponsible is cutting oil and gas production so that the cost of living, as we saw last year, starts to shoot up again,\u201d Sawan told the BBC.\n\nHis comments defending ongoing oil and gas production, which experts say is incompatible with global climate goals, underline the shift in approach at Shell under his reign towards prioritising fossil fuels and increasing payouts to shareholders. Last month the FTSE 100 company announced it was abandoning plans to cut oil extraction each year for the rest of the decade.\n\nJamie Peters, the head of climate at Friends of the Earth, said it was \u201cutterly ironic for Shell to be calling anything \u2018dangerous and irresponsible\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, companies like Shell are fuelling both the climate crisis and the soaring cost of energy. They are profiting from the misery of ordinary people while destroying the planet, and they\u2019re making a cynical case to continue locking us into the volatile fossil fuel markets that are the root cause of the energy crisis,\u201d Peters said.\n\nHe pointed out that the comments follow news of the hottest June on record and searing heatwaves, and argued they \u201cshow just how incompatible and out of touch Shell is with the urgent need to invest in clean, cheap renewables and energy efficiency, so we can all benefit from lower prices and a safe, green future\u201d.\n\nShell last month announced that it would hold its oil and gas production steady until 2030, after previously saying it would cut output by about 1-2% each year. Sawan is understood to have backtracked on the company\u2019s modest climate goals in order to take advantage of lucrative fossil fuel prices which have been stoked by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe surge in global energy prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine early last year helped Shell more than double its annual profits for the year to $40bn compared with $19bn in 2021.\n\nAlice Harrison, a campaign leader at Global Witness, said: \u201cFollowing a year of record-breaking \u00a333bn profits, the only \u2018danger\u2019 Shell would see in cutting production is to their eye-watering profits.\n\n\u201cWhether blinded by the pound signs or simply wilfully ignorant, Shell\u2019s CEO is wrong. Ending our dependence on fossil fuels and transitioning to green energy will serve both the planet and provide energy security for all. Shell have once again made their loyalties clear \u2013 profit over people and planet,\u201d she said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

            "text": "Stanford engineering professor and renewable energy expert Mark Z Jacobson tweeted the other day, \u201cGiven that scientists who study 100% renewable energy systems are unanimous that it can be done why do we hear daily on twitter and everywhere else by those who don\u2019t study such systems that it can\u2019t be done?\u201d A significant percentage of the general public speaks of climate change with a strange combination of confidence and defeatism: confidence in positions often based on inaccurate or outdated or maybe no information; defeatism about what we can do to make a livable future. Maybe they just get their facts from other doom evangelists, who flourish on the internet, no matter how much reputable scientists demonstrate their errors.\n\nThey\u2019re surrendering in advance and inspiring others to do the same. If you announce that the outcome has already been decided and we\u2019ve already lost, you strip away the motivation to participate \u2013 and of course if we do nothing we settle for the worst outcome. It often seems that people are searching harder for evidence we\u2019re defeated than that we can win. Warnings are a valuable thing, given with the sense that there\u2019s something we can do to prevent the anticipated outcome; prophesies assume the future is settled and there\u2019s nothing we can do. But the defeatists often describe a present they assert are locking in the worst outcomes.\n\nOne day this week, someone told me that she was \u201cangry at people\u2019s refusal to acknowledge what\u2019s happening to the planet\u201d and when I waved a couple of surveys at them showing that in 2023 \u201cNearly seven-in-ten Americans (69%) favor the U.S. taking steps to become carbon neutral by 2050\u201d and in 2021 \u201cthree-quarters (75%) of adults in Great Britain said they were worried about the impact of climate change\u201d they shifted to complaining about poor leadership and climate deniers. So far as I could tell, she wanted to be angry at obstacles, and if one was removed, she had others.\n\nThe climate scientist Zeke Hausfather told journalist Shannon Osaka recently \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that recently many of us climate scientists have spent more time arguing with the doomers than with the deniers\u201d for a Washington Post story titled, \u201cWhy climate \u2018doomers\u2019 are replacing climate \u2018deniers\u2019\u201d. The people putting out defeatist frameworks have more impact than outright deniers, not least because deniers are rightwingers and the right is already committed to climate inaction. Doomers discourage people who otherwise might act, so they\u2019re working toward the worst outcomes they claim to dread. You would expect them to be quietly unmotivated, but a lot of them seem to have an evangelical passion for recruiting others to their views.\n\nThe same day I was told the public doesn\u2019t care, a couple of other people told me that \u201cthe media is not covering\u201d the climate crisis. This was a reasonable position five or 10 years ago, but isn\u2019t at present. Mainstream print media, with its own enthusiasm for grim takes, oversimplification of nuanced climate reports, and distractions like last fall\u2019s fake fusion energy breakthrough, is not doing the job the way I\u2019d like to see it get done. But it is covering climate. There were, for example, multiple climate stories on the online front pages of the Washington Post and the New York Times that day.\n\nYet another person complained to me that day, \u201cit\u2019s hard to stay hopeful when the New York Times tells us no need to worry, just take a nap,\u201d referencing a story in the Times about Spanish siestas as a way of coping with heat, but when I went to look that story was clustered on the webpage with a number of serious reports about the current extreme heat and climate emergency. There are a lot of things wrong with the New York Times, but the paper was covering climate seriously that day.\n\nMany things that were once true \u2013 that we didn\u2019t have adequate solutions, that the general public wasn\u2019t aware or engaged \u2013 no longer are. Outdated information is misinformation, and the climate situation has changed a lot in recent years. The physical condition of the planet \u2013 as this summer\u2019s unprecedented extreme heat and flooding and Canada\u2019s and Greece\u2019s colossal fires demonstrate \u2013 has continued to get worse; the solutions have continued to get better; the public is far more engaged; the climate movement has grown, though of course it needs to grow far more; and there have been some significant victories as well as the incremental change of a shifting energy landscape.\n\nMost positive climate news doesn\u2019t make very dramatic reading, and I usually find it in technical journals, tweets from scientists and policymakers, and climate-specific news services. It\u2019s often about incremental stuff, like that we\u2019re deploying more wind and solar and using less fossil fuel to generate electricity. Or it\u2019s about legislation or technical things like new battery storage materials or less polluting concrete formulas. Or it unpacks surveys showing that most people support climate action. Mostly they tell us that we have the capacity or are increasing the capacity to do what will limit the crisis. They\u2019re interim reports, and the public often seems to want final scores, to know how the story will end. We don\u2019t know because we\u2019re deciding that now.\n\nA lot of people in this society also like certainty and while it\u2019s obviously foolish to be certain we will win, somehow certainty we will lose isn\u2019t subject to the same judgments. That certainty seems to come in part from an assumption that change happens in predictable ways, so we can know the future, or that there are environmental but not social and technological tipping points. But, as the thinktank Carbon Tracker notes \u201cThe S-curve is a well-established phenomenon where a successful new technology reaches a certain catalytic tipping point (typically 5-10% market share), and then rapidly reaches a high market share (i.e. 50%+) within just a couple more years once past this tipping point. Solar panels, wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries have all followed such learning curves. Each technology has declined in cost by over 90% in the past two decades. And so their growth has followed an S-curve model.\u201d Change is often not linear but exponential, or it\u2019s unpredictable, like an earthquake releasing centuries of tension. Big changes start small, and history is studded with surprises.\n\nI don\u2019t know why so many people seem to think it\u2019s their job to spread discouragement, but it seems to be a muddle about the relationship between facts and feelings. I keep saying I respect despair as an emotion, but not as an analysis. You can feel absolutely devastated about the situation and not assume this predicts outcome; you can have your feelings and can still chase down facts from reliable sources, and the facts tell us that the general public is not the problem; the fossil fuel industry and other vested interests are; that we have the solutions, that we know what to do, and that the obstacles are political; that when we fight we sometimes win; and that we are deciding the future now.\n\nI wonder sometimes if it\u2019s because people assume you can\u2019t be hopeful and heartbroken at the same time, and of course you can. In times when everything is fine hope is unnecessary. Hope is not happiness or confidence or inner peace; it\u2019s a commitment to search for possibilities. Feelings deserve full respect as feelings, but all they inform you about is you. History is full of people who continued to struggle in desperate and grim circumstances, and so is the news from Ukraine to the Philippines. Some lived to see those circumstances change because of that struggle. Maybe this is what Antonio Gramsci meant with his famous phrase \u201cpessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will\u201d. Some days I think that if we lose the climate battle, it\u2019ll be due in no small part to this defeatism among the comfortable in the global north, while people in frontline communities continue to fight like hell for survival. Which is why fighting defeatism is also climate work.",

            "publish_date": "2023-07-13T00:00:00",
            "text": "Sultan Al Jaber, president of the Cop28 UN climate summit to be held this November in the United Arab Emirates, has laid out his long-awaited plan of action at a meeting of governments in Brussels.\n\nThe plan covers all the main aspects of climate action, based on the 2015 Paris agreement, now divided into what Al Jaber termed the four pillars, or four Fs: fast-tracking the transition to a low-CO 2 world; fixing climate finance; focusing on people, lives and livelihoods; and full inclusivity.\n\nThe Cop president\u2019s plan was broadly welcomed by experts and civil society on Thursday. Harjeet Singh of the Climate Action Network said: \u201c[It] sends the right signals about the key elements required for a successful climate summit. [But] while the broad contours are positive, the devil will be in the details.\u201d\n\nHere is a breakdown of the details.\n\nThe 1.5C goal\n\nThe Paris agreement required countries to hold global temperature rises \u201cwell below 2C\u201d above pre-industrial levels, while \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to stay within 1.5C. Since 2015, science has shown that 2C would entail calamitous impacts, so at Cop26 in 2021 governments agreed to focus on the more stringent goal of 1.5C.\n\nLast year, some governments tried to unpick that commitment to 1.5C, so Al Jaber made clear from the outset that his plan was based on the tougher, and safer, goal. \u201cThis plan is guided by a single north star, and that is keeping 1.5C within reach,\u201d he told ministers.\n\nKate Hampton, chief executive of the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation, who worked unpaid on the plan, said: \u201cThe commitment to 1.5C is particularly important \u2013 the presidency has recognised it is time to accelerate the essential and inevitable end for fossil fuels. The challenge now for the presidency is to ensure delivery across a comprehensive agenda, which can only be achieved with a transformational plan for mobilising finance.\u201d\n\nNational plans\n\nAt Cop28, governments will conduct for the first time a \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d that will set out the progress countries have made on the emissions reduction commitments \u2013 known as \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d or NDCs \u2013 they made in Paris.\n\nThe stocktake is certain to find that the world is way off track to meet its Paris goals, but the Cop presidency has decided against naming and shaming individual countries. Instead, all countries will be required to submit updated NDCs in September, that are sufficiently tough to meet the 1.5 goal.\n\nUAE has submitted a revision to its NDC, with emissions reductions of 40% compared with business as usual.\n\nPhase out or phase down?\n\nAl Jaber emphasised that this effort would entail \u201cthe phase down of fossil fuels\u201d, which he said was \u201cinevitable and essential\u201d.\n\nThe wording is significant. Al Jaber was heavily criticised two months ago for repeatedly referring to the \u201cphase out of fossil fuel emissions\u201d, which observers took to mean that oil and gas companies could carry on extracting fossil fuels as long as the resulting carbon dioxide was somehow captured. But scientists have warned against using carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) as a \u201cfree lunch\u201d to excuse continued extraction.\n\nThe phrasing \u201cphase down\u201d will also disappoint campaigners and the 80-plus countries who want Cop28 to pass a commitment to phasing out fossil fuels entirely.\n\nClean energy\n\nCommitments to double energy efficiency, triple renewable energy capacity to 11,000GW globally, and double hydrogen production to 180m tonnes a year by 2030 will be put to governments at Cop28, and are expected to be agreed.\n\nRomain Ioualalen, global policy lead at Oil Change International, said: \u201cRecent history has shown that more renewable energy does not automatically translate into less fossil fuels. Cop28 will only be a success if its presidency sets aside the interests of the oil and gas industry and facilitates a clear outcome on the need for a decline of all fossil fuel production and use, as well as a rapid phase-in of wind and solar. The only way we\u2019ll build a new energy system that is both clean and fair is by actively phasing out the old.\u201d\n\nFossil fuel companies\n\nAs well as leading Cop28, Al Jaber is chief of the UAE\u2019s national oil and gas company, Adnoc. He has spearheaded an attempt to bring fossil fuel executives to Cop28, arguing that they must have a place at the table, despite the misgivings of many campaigners.\n\nHe wants to formulate a plan with the world\u2019s biggest oil and gas producers \u2013 both nationally owned and private sector \u2013 to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5C. If this can be agreed, it would be an astonishing step forward for climate action.\n\nBob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cThere has been criticism of Al Jaber\u2019s links with the national oil company, claiming they prevent him from being a credible Cop president. But this speech shows detailed ambitions for progress on the major issues, including a recognition of the need for oil companies to be part of the solution. If Cop28 does deliver all the ambitions outlined, it would be one of the most important summits in history.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

This implies a just and equitable fossil fuel phaseout, ambitious targets for sustainably scaling up renewables, and adequate finance to implement this plan.\u201d\n\n\u2018All emissions, everywhere\u2019\n\nInitially, when Al Jaber spoke to oil and gas companies earlier this year, he focused on what they could do to make their operations less carbon-intensive, such as improving their extraction efficiency and plugging leaks of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. These are known as scope 1 emissions in climate jargon \u2013 or emissions fully under a company\u2019s control.\n\nCritics pointed out, however, that this ignored by far the greatest impact of fossil fuels, which comes when they are consumed and produce CO 2 \u2013 known as \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions. (Scope 2 emissions are those coming from the purchase of energy from outside sources.)\n\nOn Thursday, Al Jaber promised these would be included:\n\n\u201cLet us end the reductive discussion of scope 1 v scope 2 v scope 3. We need to attack all emissions, everywhere: one, two and three.\u201d\n\nClimate finance\n\nDeveloping countries are already facing devastation from the impacts of the climate crisis, and they lack the finance to shift their economies to a low-CO 2 footing. But the climate finance currently available to them is too little, too hard to access, and skewed towards the richer among them.\n\nAl Jaber called for \u201ca comprehensive transformation\u201d of the World Bank and other international finance institutions, and for private sector funding to be brought in.\n\nHe wants to ensure that a longstanding commitment by rich countries to provide $100bn (\u00a376.5bn) a year to poor nations, which was supposed to be met in 2020 but has not yet been achieved, is finally delivered. He also repeated the demand by the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for a doubling of finance for developing countries to adapt to climate impacts.\n\nLast year at Cop27, nations agreed to set up a fund for loss and damage, meaning the rescue and rehabilitation of countries stricken by the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Al Jaber said it was \u201cabsolutely imperative\u201d that the means to fill this fund should be agreed at Cop28, with a view to disbursing the first cash soon after.\n\nInclusivity\n\nUAE is not a democracy, and civil expression is tightly controlled. Al Jaber reassured civil society groups that they would be welcomed at Cop28, highlighting the role of Indigenous people, youth and faith-based organisations, along with mayors and local leaders.\n\nInclusivity for UAE also involves private sector companies, however, including oil companies, which climate campaigners and some governments are less keen on.\n\nSingh said: \u201cWe must ensure that Cop28 is free from the influence of the fossil fuel industry and holds these polluters accountable.\u201d\n\nAlok Sharma, the former UK minister and president of Cop26, took a more positive view, saying: \u201cIt would be a remarkable achievement of Cop28 if it became the Cop which sets the pace and timeline on consigning fossil fuels to history.\u201d",

We knew \u2013 just like we know gravity \u2013 that Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef could be one of the earliest victims of uncontained global warming.\n\nBut as today\u2019s monstrous, deadly heatwaves overtake large parts of Asia, Europe and North America with temperatures the likes of which we have never experienced, we find even 1.2C of global warming isn\u2019t safe.\n\n00:02:47 Severe heatwaves engulf the northern hemisphere \u2013 video report\n\nDriving all this is the fossil fuel industry. Enabling it are political leaders unwilling to bring this industry under control and who promote policies such as offsetting and massive gas expansion that simply enable this industry to continue.\n\nBill Hare, physicist and climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics\n\nIt\u2019s as if the human race has received a terminal medical diagnosis and knows there is a cure, but has consciously decided not to save itself. Prof Lesley Hughes\n\n\u2018What other choice do we have?\u2019\n\nThis is what climate change looks like now. And this is what climate change looks like in the future, though it will likely continue to get worse.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many more warnings the world needs. It\u2019s as if the human race has received a terminal medical diagnosis and knows there is a cure, but has consciously decided not to save itself.\n\nBut those of us who understand, and who care, just have to keep trying \u2013 after all, what other choice do we have?\n\nProf Lesley Hughes, board member of the Climate Change Authority and an emeritus professor at Macquarie University\n\n\u2018History will judge them very harshly\u2019\n\nI still recall reading the 1985 Villach conference report, alerting the scientific community to the possible link between greenhouse gas production and climate change. In 1988, I directed the Australian Commission for the Future and worked with CSIRO\u2019s Graeme Pearman on Greenhouse \u201888, a program to draw public attention to what the science was showing.\n\nNow all the projected changes are happening, so I reflect on how much needless environmental damage and human suffering will result from the work of those politicians, business leaders and public figures who have prevented concerted action. History will judge them very harshly.\n\nProf Ian Lowe, emeritus professor in the School of Science at Griffith University\n\n\u2018Only time will tell\u2019\n\nWhile we\u2019ve been saying for decades now that this is what to expect, it\u2019s still very confronting to see these climate extremes play out with such ferocity and with such global reach. It\u2019s going to be Australia\u2019s turn this summer, no doubt about it.\n\nIt makes me feel deeply frustrated to watch the slow pace of policy action \u2013 it\u2019s bewildering to see new fossil fuel extraction projects still getting the go-ahead here in Australia. And with this comes deep resentment for those who have lobbied for ongoing fossil fuel use despite the clear climate physics that have been known about for almost half a century.\n\nOver the last few weeks I\u2019ve found myself wondering is this finally going to be the year when any doubts about the climate change crisis are blown away by a spate of costly climate extremes. That could be one benefit of 2023 being off the charts like this. Only time will tell.\n\nProf Matthew England, scientia professor, Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science (ACEAS), University of New South Wales\n\nTrees burn during a wildfire at Metochi village, near Epidaurus, Greece on Sunday. Photograph: Bougiotis Evangelos/EPA\n\n\u2018What we are living through now is just the beginning\u2019\n\nI spent the last four weeks at a German research institute in the middle of the current heatwave. Travelling to my hometown, Berlin, on weekends to see my elderly and sick dad, trying to keep him cool in his city flat and convincing him that drinking water might be a good idea (not always successfully). I also bragged to colleagues and friends complaining about the heat, \u201cThis is nothing; try to live through a heatwave in Australia!\u201d Australia is great for bragging. There are always bigger, more extreme and more venomous examples down under.\n\nI felt a mild scientific curiosity to see materialise what we have been forecasting for years. Prof Katrin Meissner\n\nWas I surprised by this heatwave? Of course I was not. If anything I felt a mild scientific curiosity to see materialise what we have been forecasting for years. I also felt sad. We know that what we are living through now is just the beginning of much worse conditions to come. What this will do to our ecosystems, water availability, human health, infrastructure and supply chains? We know the answer. But I can also see signs of change. More than once, I was almost run over by a bike; I was not used to the busy bike lanes in Germany. I also spent many hours on trains and saw a real change in the landscape flying by. I travelled through large solar and windfarms and I listened in on conversations between co-travellers, which more often than not revolved around climate change. In one of them someone mentioned that all these sunny countries, like Australia, are likely 100% on renewable energy by now. I smiled silently; there are still some things we cannot brag about in Australia (yet).\n\nProf Katrin Meissner, director of the Climate Change Research Centre, University of NSW\n\n\u2018This should cause us concern\u2019\n\nIt is distressing to see the widespread damage caused by the current outbreak of extreme events in many parts of the globe. Unfortunately, they are not a one-off but part of a longer trend fuelled by human greenhouse gas emissions. So they are not unexpected.\n\nWorryingly, it is clear that future extremes will again break records and cause even greater damage. In particular, this is because the damage in many cases is nonlinear \u2013 it rises more and more quickly for each increment of climate change. This should cause us concern. It rationally should cause us to step back and assess what is in our economic, social and environmental interests. The IPCC has done this and the assessment is clear: it is in our interest to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rapidly, substantially and in a sustained way.\n\nIt is also in our interest to put in place large and integrated programs for climate adaptation to deal with the climate change impacts we can\u2019t avoid. Taking action to reduce emissions and to adapt to climate change will give us hope. Do we really want the alternative?",

            "text": "When floods swept Europe in July 2021, killing more than 200 people in Germany, Belgium and neighbouring countries, it was a disaster that came as the climate crisis was moving to the top of Europe\u2019s political agenda. All of a sudden, climate was no longer an abstract threat that could be batted into a distant future; it was already here, causing shocking weather events, destroying lives and leaving people homeless.\n\nIn northern Europe especially, spurred by the Fridays for Future school strikes, the climate crisis had already spilled into politics, pushing policy into action. But in 2021, measurable progress towards the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 began to be made. The EU didn\u2019t just limit itself to ambitious targets, enshrined in laws and regulations. It also put its money where its mouth was.\n\nNeither the pandemic nor Russia\u2019s subsequent invasion of Ukraine distracted its focus. On the contrary, Europe used these crises to put flesh on the bones of a green deal, accelerating its race to net zero. As a result of the pandemic, the EU agreed to channel 37% of its economic recovery funds to the energy transition, while in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the energy crisis it unleashed, European countries stepped up their investments in renewables and energy efficiency as they strived to wean themselves off Russian gas.\n\nIn 2022, renewables overtook gas to become the leading source of electricity generation in the EU, with solar power leaping by a record 24%. Key policies have also been approved, from the extension of carbon pricing to cover the politically sensitive areas of buildings and transport, to the adoption of a carbon border tax to ensure that as EU industry is forced to decarbonise, Europe doesn\u2019t end up importing dirtier and cheaper products from elsewhere. A few weeks ago, a senior official at the European Commission told me that the EU had completed the lion\u2019s share of its green agenda in this legislative cycle, well beyond Brussels\u2019 rosiest expectations a few years ago.\n\nYet grey (or rather brown) clouds are now massing on the horizon. Across Europe, worrying signs of a green backlash are surfacing, as citizens and businesses start feeling the costs of the energy transition. Dutch farmers are up in arms over stringent limits on nitrogen emissions, arguing that they will make European agriculture financially unviable. The German public is fretting over the phaseout of gas boilers, while the car industry has successfully squeezed in a loophole for synthetic fuels to lengthen the lifespan of conventional combustion engines, which are meant to be phased out across the EU by 2035. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, have both publicly called for a \u201cpause\u201d in the EU\u2019s green legislative agenda, while Poland is fighting for exemptions to sustain its coal subsidies. In the European parliament, conservatives and centre-right MEPs are putting spokes in the wheels of the nature conservation law, the biodiversity part of the EU\u2019s green deal.\n\nThere are two opposing interpretations of this \u201cgreenlash\u201d. The first is that pressure is mounting against the green agenda because it is now real. As long as climate action was an abstract, lofty goal, it was easy for everyone to pay lip service to it. You could do the right thing and stand up for action on the climate crisis without paying the price for it. Now the hard part \u2013 although action is still far too slow and uneven \u2013 is actually happening. This change, often referred to as a green \u201ctransition\u201d, is revolutionary in its scope, complexity and the speed at which it is meant to be taking place. And revolutions have winners and losers.\n\nIt is only natural that the \u201closers\u201d want to make their voices heard \u2013 but it is up to politics to channel that dissent, and to find ways of compensating those opposing voices to ensure that their resistance does not derail the journey to net zero. The reality of decarbonisation will surely differ from the original plan, as the social, economic and political repercussions play out and unforeseen technological breakthroughs take place. In short, the \u201cgreenlash\u201d proves that the move to net zero is real, not that Europeans are going into reverse on climate action.\n\nBut the second interpretation says the opposite might be true: the pushback against green policies could be the sign of worse to come. As EU countries such as Spain, Slovakia and Poland prepare for elections later this year, and with European parliament elections in 2024, there is a real risk that rightwing, populist parties will latch on to the \u201cgreenlash\u201d and surge back in the polls. While no longer openly climate crisis deniers, they denounce the inequalities and the harm caused to industry they say are exacerbated by climate policies.\n\nThey call for an \u201cecological sovereignty\u201d, which, rather than pressing for decarbonisation, insists on the preservation of landscapes from the supposed visual horrors of wind and solar farms, and on the preservation of traditional food and agriculture from the purported abomination of synthetic meats and alternative sources of proteins, such as insects.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At times, reality is turned on its head. When floods devastated the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy in May, the hard-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, didn\u2019t point the finger at the obvious culprit, climate change. In a remarkable pirouette, she actually blamed climate policy, which she claimed had prevented the construction of infrastructure that would have saved property and lives.\n\nIf the green divide deepens in Europe, this could slow down the existential race we\u2019re in. That risks delaying not so much the decarbonisation agenda \u2013 existing laws and policies, technology and market forces suggest this will happen simply because it makes economic sense \u2013 but rather the wider sustainability agenda, focused on biodiversity, agriculture and nature conservation. There is sadly less money to make from this agenda. It is here that a political backlash, coupled with the absence of a profit-driven corporate interest, risks derailing Europe\u2019s role in saving people and planet alike.",

He has a wealth of relevant experience behind him and a sure foot in treading the minefield of international politics.

            "text": "We\u2019ve passed into a ferocious new phase of global heating with much worse to come. Biden must declare a climate emergency.\n\nI\u2019m terrified by what\u2019s being done to our planet. I\u2019m also fighting to stop it. You, too, should be afraid while also taking the strongest action you can take. There has never been a summer like this in recorded history: shocking ocean heat, deadly land heat, unprecedented fires and smoke, sea ice melting faster than we\u2019ve ever seen or thought possible. I\u2019ve dreaded this depth of Earth breakdown for almost two decades, and, like many of my colleagues, I\u2019ve been trying to warn you. As hard as I could. Now it\u2019s here.\n\nAnd mark my words: it\u2019s all still just getting started. So long as we burn fossil fuels, far, far worse is on the way; and I take zero satisfaction in knowing that this will be proven right, too, with a certainty as non-negotiable and merciless as the physics behind fossil-fueled global heating. Instead, I only feel fury at those in power, and bottomless grief for all that I love. We are losing Earth on our watch. The Amazon rainforest may already be past its tipping point. Coral reefs as we know them will be gone from our planet by mid-century, and possibly much earlier given this surge in sea-surface temperatures. These are cosmic losses. And as a father, I grieve for my children.\n\nFossil fuels are causing this damage. Therefore, the only way out of this heat nightmare is to end them. No amount of tree planting, recycling, carbon offsetting, or wishful carbon-capture thinking will ever change this. The longer we allow the fossil fuel industry to exist, the more irreversible damage to Earth the people who profit from it will continue to knowingly cause. We are careening toward fossil-fueled heatwaves that will kill over a million people in single events. And it will not plateau there: more fossil fuels, more heat, more death. The only way out is to end fossil fuels.\n\nBiden\u2019s refusal to declare a climate emergency and his eagerness to push new pipelines and new drilling \u2013 at an even faster pace than Trump \u2013 goes against science, goes against common sense, goes against life on Earth. In the world of politics-as-usual, with its short-term goals and calculus of \u201csafer to follow than to lead\u201d, I suppose there are reasons and rationalizations for this planet-destroying choice. But speaking as a scientist, it seems ignorant and short-sighted. It\u2019s certainly a form of climate denial. And I have no doubt that fossil fuel executives and lobbyists \u2013 and those who chose to stand with them \u2013 will, in the future, be considered criminals.\n\nBecause the stakes could not be greater. Every speck of fossil fuel sold and burnt combusts into carbon dioxide, forcing the planet to heat. Carbon dioxide resides in the atmosphere for a very long time, making the excess heat and other climate impacts basically irreversible on human-relevant timescales. Every bit of extra heat makes climate disasters more frequent, widespread and intense.\n\nEach minute the fossil fuel industry exists, each drilling permit, airplane flight, gallon of gas, fossil fuel ad, lobbyist\u2019s email, takes us further into irreversible heat catastrophe, socially and physically. These floods and fires and heatwaves and crop failures will keep pushing harder against the systems of our society \u2013 insurance, real estate, infrastructure, food, water, energy, geopolitics, everything \u2013 until at some point, inevitably, the systems will break. Nowhere is safe.\n\nUsing executive orders and federal agency rules, and without needing to involve this failure of a Congress, Biden could end new drilling leases on federal lands and waters, block new pipelines and effectively ban fracking. He could unleash a historic education program to counter fossil fuel industry disinformation, using the bully pulpit to build awareness and support. He could prohibit government financing of overseas fossil fuel infrastructure, end energy department fossil-fuel financing programs, ban new fossil-fuel vehicle sales by 2030, prosecute violations by fossil fuel polluters, commit to veto laws granting immunity to such criminals, and more.\n\nDeclaring a climate emergency would unleash additional powers such as banning oil exports and further accelerating renewable energy buildout on a scale not seen since the mobilization for the second world war. It would send an unmistakable signal to investors still living in the past, to universities that have been shamefully slow to divest, to media outlets that have failed to connect the dots, to all the dangerously lagging institutions of our society. And it would be a desperately needed win for climate activists.\n\nBiden had the last opportunity of any president to keep the world under 1.5C of heating. Tragically, this opportunity has now almost certainly been squandered. However, Biden could still choose to pivot and prevent, instead of cause, even greater damage. But will he choose to do so? Or will he continue to champion oil executives and their pipelines?\n\nThe planet is desperate for visionary leadership. The planet is desperate for policy that creates an equitable transition away from fossil fuels, and into climate emergency mode as a society.\n\nI have not given up, and I never will. I owe that to my children, to all the good people who don\u2019t deserve this, and to all the life on this gift of a planet. No matter how much we\u2019ve lost, it will never be too late to fight. But the hour is late. It is time to set aside differences and fight together, as creatively and courageously as we can, to save all we still can. Soon, all but the greatest fools among us will realize that nothing was more important.",

            "publish_date": "2023-07-26T00:00:00",
            "text": "What was long predicted is now happening. Earth\u2019s weather systems are increasingly disrupted and destructive, as a consequence of the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to devastating heatwaves in the northern hemisphere, and their role in igniting forest fires, high sea temperatures over recent months have led scientists to reiterate their warnings that we are moving fast into uncharted, dangerous territory.\n\nClimate models have always allowed for uncertainty. For decades, scientists have been certain of the direction of travel: towards increased heat, risk and instability. But how precisely the crisis would manifest, in what order systems would break down, and how the knock-on effects would unfold, remains a subject for research and discussion. Currently, there is a debate between experts about whether the pace of global heating is accelerating or stable. The likelihood of vital ocean currents, known as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, collapsing this century is also contested. One new study has suggested that a tipping point could be approaching, and that the analysis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has, in this respect, been too conservative.\n\nThe causes of record-breaking ocean temperatures are also being investigated. While an El Ni\u00f1o weather event was expected this year, it is not regarded as a sufficient explanation of the ocean temperature rises recorded since April. Heat is also thought to be causing oceans\u2019 colour to change from blue to green, due to increased plankton. The situation is particularly concerning because we have relied on the oceans to absorb 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases. Dr Bernadette Sloyan, a marine scientist in Australia, has compared their role to that of an air conditioner.\n\nWarmer seas present specific dangers, both to human and marine life: melting ice sheets; sea level rises (because water expands when heated); coral bleaching; more intense storms; lower oxygen levels causing fish to die. But they are also an indication of the overall pressure that global heating is placing on nature. The Earth\u2019s capacity to stabilise the amounts of energy entering and leaving the planet\u2019s system is reaching its limits for current patterns of existence.\n\nFor many of those focused on what is happening \u2013 including activists, scientists and politicians \u2013 the inadequacy of national and international responses to the emergency is disorienting as well as disturbing. Despite decades of pledges made under the auspices of the UN\u2019s climate process, global emissions are at an all-time high. It is hard to fathom what further evidence is needed to persuade governments that a drastic change of course is the safest option.\n\nBut it is clear that the countries and businesses that are most strongly reliant on fossil-fuel profits will not willingly give them up. Whether and how they can be convinced or compelled to do so is the existential question of our times. Last weekend the G20 bloc of nations \u2013 which produce 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 failed to reach agreement on phasing down fossil fuels. This November\u2019s round of UN talks, Cop28, is being held in the United Arab Emirates and led by Sultan Al Jaber, who also heads his country\u2019s national oil company. As forests burn and the sea turns green, the necessity of confronting vested interests \u2013 including energy-intensive western-type lifestyles as well as the corporations that depend on fossil fuels for profits \u2013 becomes more desperate by the day.",

Winters have also become warmer, and less winter snow results in a drier spring, leading to severe drought and increased forest fires,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe need to recalibrate the way we manage natural disasters, not just by reflecting recent events but by incorporating the expected risks of the future,\u201d he says. \u201cMore importantly, the government needs to enhance its mitigation efforts. Climate adaptation and mitigation must go hand in hand.\u201d\n\n\u2018A fossil fuel-based inertia\u2019\n\nDr Lee Yu-jin, vice-director of the Green Transition Institute, says that while South Korea appears to be following international discussions, such as the 2050 carbon neutrality declaration and NDCs as part of the Paris agreement, challenges remain to its commitments, given the export-oriented structure of its economy.\n\n\u201cKorea is still trapped in energy-intensive industries and a fossil fuel-based inertia, which puts it at a high risk of falling behind in the rapid decarbonisation trend,\u201d she says, accusing the country of lagging behind in global climate crisis response and the transition to renewable energy, \u201cleaving it isolated like an island\u201d.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s traditional industries, which underpin much of the country\u2019s economy, such as semiconductors, automobiles, and shipbuilding, are all carbon-intensive.\n\nFossil fuels are responsible for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and are by far the most significant contributor to climate change.\n\nAccording to UK-based thinktank Ember, South Korea has one of the highest levels of greenhouse gas pollution from coal per person in the developed world, and in 2022, wind and solar accounted for just 5.4% of the country\u2019s electricity production, much less than the global average of 12%.\n\nThe country is also one of the largest public financiers of fossil fuel projects around the world.\n\nJoojin Kim, executive director of Solutions for Our Climate, says that for South Korea to do its part, it must phase out coal by at least 2030 and gas by 2035.\n\nRescue workers search for people in a house that collapsed after a landslide caused by heavy rain in Yeongju, South Korea. Photograph: AP\n\nThe government has committed to decreasing emissions by 40% below 2018 levels by 2030 and set a target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. However, under Yoon, it has changed how it would achieve this, by reducing the industrial emissions reduction target and shifting it to carbon capture technology and international offsets.\n\nThe current government also stated that it would speed up the transition to clean energy by cutting coal-fired power generation and expanding nuclear and renewable energy, with the latter target lowered in favour of nuclear power.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be achieved unless the government is willing to transform our fossil fuel-oriented energy system, and to cease bankrolling fossil fuel expansion,\u201d Kim says.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea has the financial, human, and technological resources to phase out fossil fuels. What it lacks is the political will and policies to incentivise a faster transition.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean government has said it will prepare \u201creasonable implementation measures\u201d for reduction targets and strategies, \u201cconsidering economic and social conditions and feasibility\u201d, to comply with the greenhouse gas reduction targets committed to in the international community.\n\nThe legal basis regulating gas emissions targets and carbon neutrality was recently challenged by the state human rights commission, which said it was unconstitutional since the target was too low and unfairly passed the burden to future generations.\n\nFor Kim Seo-gyeong, the youth climate activist, the reality of South Korea\u2019s response to the climate crisis is disheartening.\n\n\u201cThe measures taken by the government are insufficient to prevent the climate crisis or protect citizens from social inequality and risks caused by the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cThe disasters we face today are just beginning.\u201d",

            "text": "Thirty years ago, the world\u2019s nations agreed to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. But what is \u201cdangerous climate change\u201d? Just turn on the television, read the headlines of the morning paper or view your social media feeds. For we are watching it play out in real time this summer, more profoundly than ever before, in the form of unprecedented floods, heatwaves and wildfires. Now we know what dangerous climate change looks like. As has been said of obscenity, we know it when we see it. We\u2019re seeing it \u2013 and it is obscene.\n\nScorching temperatures persist across Europe, North America and Asia, as wildfires rage from Canada to Greece. The heat is as relentless as it is intense. For example, Phoenix, Arizona, has broken its record of 18 consecutive days above 110F (43.3C). Even the nights, generally relied upon as a chance to recover from the blistering days, now offer little relief: for more than a week, night-time temperatures in Phoenix have exceeded 90F (32.2C). Meanwhile, severe and deadly flooding has stricken South Korea, Japan, and the north-east United States, from Pennsylvania to Vermont.\n\nThe climate crisis \u2013 and yes, it is now a crisis \u2013 is endangering us now, where we live. Whether it\u2019s the recurrent episodes of hazardous air quality in the east coast cities some of us call home from windblown Canadian wildfire smoke or the toll sadly now being measured in human lives from deadly nearby floods, we are witnessing the devastating and dangerous consequences of unabated human-caused warming. That is a fact.\n\nIndeed, as you \u201cdoomscroll\u201d on whatever social media platform you prefer these days, you might see selective images and graphs that would lead you to think Earth\u2019s climate is spinning out of control, in a runaway feedback loop of irreversible tipping points leading us down an inescapable planetary death spiral.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\n\nThe average warming of the planet \u2013 including the most up-to-date measurements for 2023 \u2013 is entirely consistent with what climate modelers warned decades ago would happen if we continued with the business-as-usual burning of fossil fuels. Yes, there are alarming data coming in, from record-shattering loss of winter sea ice in the southern hemisphere to off-the-charts warmth in the North Atlantic with hot tub-grade waters off the Florida coast. We\u2019ve also seen the hottest week on record for the planet as a whole this month. We can attribute blame to a combination of ongoing human-caused warming, an incipient major El Ni\u00f1o event and the vagaries of natural variability.\n\nThese episodes are a reminder that we can not only expect to see records broken, but shattered, if we continue burning fossil fuels and heating up the planet.\n\nAnd one of the areas where observed trends truly are exceeding the predictions of climate models is in those extreme weather events we are seeing this summer. One of us has been involved in research that suggests that climate models are still not capturing some of the more subtle physical mechanisms behind persistent summer weather extremes. As the Arctic warms faster than lower latitudes, the temperature difference between the poles and tropics decreases and the jet stream \u2013 which is driven by that difference \u2013 weakens. Under certain conditions that can lead to a slow, wiggly jet stream, with amplified weather systems that get stuck in place. When weather systems stall like this, the same regions get baked or rained on day after day \u2013 precisely the sort of persistent, extreme weather events we\u2019re experiencing this summer.\n\nThe incessant parade of heat domes, floods and tornado outbreaks this summer seems to suggest a precarious if not downright apocalyptic \u201cnew abnormal\u201d that we now find ourselves in. And it understandably feeds the fearful impression that we\u2019ve exceeded some sort of breaking point in our climate.\n\nHow do we reconcile that impression with the picture that emerges from the steady, rather than erratic, warming response we see in both the observations and models? The answer is that the behavior of Earth\u2019s climate system represents a tussle between sometimes opposing mechanisms that alternatively favor stability and fragility. That constant tussle is evident in an examination of Earth\u2019s past climate history. If the system is pushed, it responds steadily \u2013 to a point. Push too hard, however, and we risk crossing certain \u201ctipping points\u201d, such as the disintegration of the ice sheets and the massive sea level rise that will ultimately follow.\n\nThe only way to avoid crossing these tipping points is to stop heating up the planet. And comprehensive Earth system models show that if we stop adding carbon pollution, the warming of Earth\u2019s surface stops soon thereafter.\n\nSo that brings us back to where we started. Yes, we have failed to prevent dangerous climate change. It is here. What remains to be seen is just how bad we\u2019re willing to let it get. A window of opportunity remains for averting a catastrophic 1.5C/2.7F warming of the planet, beyond which we\u2019ll see far worse consequences than anything we\u2019ve seen so far. But that window is closing and we\u2019re not making enough progress.\n\nWe cannot afford to give in to despair. Better to channel our energy into action, as there\u2019s so much work to be done to prevent this crisis from escalating into a catastrophe. If the extremes of this summer fill you with fears of imminent and inevitable climate collapse, remember, it\u2019s not game over. It\u2019s game on.",

            "text": "Some would argue that the speech by Tony Blair at Labour\u2019s 1994 party conference in Blackpool was era-defining. \u201cIt is time to break out of the past and break through with a clear, radical and modern vision for Britain,\u201d he said.\n\nOne may disagree with that vision \u2013 but he committed to it years before his election, and delivered much of it in the years after. Huge investment in public services; a minimum wage; a Freedom of Information Act; devolution for Scotland and Wales, and commitment to peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nNo one is likely to mistake me for a Blairite \u2013 and I won\u2019t glorify the record of a man who took us to an illegal and immoral war on a false prospectus. But he offers a telling comparison with the current flip-flopping, pledge-breaking, utterly undaring Labour leader, Keir Starmer.\n\nA lot has changed in the past three years, let alone the past 30. Brexit, Covid, Ukraine and Liz Truss\u2019s omnishambolic mini-budget have changed our nation\u2019s economic course. But one change frequently omitted from that list is the climate. The Earth has heated up more in the past 30 years than it did in the previous 110 \u2013 and that will only accelerate further over the next 30. On climate, as the US campaigner Bill McKibben famously observed, winning slowly is the same as losing.\n\nInexplicably, Starmer seems intent on losing. In 2021, Labour laid out an ambitious climate investment plan of \u00a328bn a year until 2030. That commitment has now been postponed in favour of a promise to \u201cramp up\u201d towards \u00a328bn in the second half of its parliamentary term.\n\nA zero-carbon economy fit for the future won\u2019t come about by chance \u2013 nor by sole reliance on the private sector. Public investment is essential, and urgent. Upscaling storage technologies, developing wave energy and floating offshore wind, restoring sewage-filled rivers and upskilling millions of workers to fill the green jobs we need for this transformation: these are no mean feats. But that\u2019s no reason to delay investment \u2013 it\u2019s a reason to accelerate it.\n\nAnd after the government\u2019s new climate adaptation programme, released this week, amounted to nothing more than recycled pledges to do more research \u2013 rather than to actually deliver the adaptation measures we desperately need \u2013 this investment simply couldn\u2019t be more urgent.\n\nPublic investment must be bolstered by public ownership, too \u2013 yet another Labour broken promise. Starmer\u2019s 2020 commitment to \u201csupport common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water\u201d has been obliterated to the extent that only rail could see a potential return to public hands \u2013 hardly a bold move considering the Tories have already nationalised chunks of it. Even after the scandal of Thames Water\u2019s crippling debt, Starmer won\u2019t commit to running public services for the public good, and protecting our natural environment rather than private profit.\n\nA protest against the planned development of the Rosebank oil and gas field in Aberdeen, June 2023. Photograph: Andrew Perry/PA\n\nIt would be easy enough to criticise Labour\u2019s self-imposed fiscal straitjacket, and just suggest that it borrows more to fund these promises \u2013 which it certainly should. Not least because that investment will not only pay for itself over time, but pay literal dividends \u2013 globally, switching from fossil fuels to clean energy could save as much as \u00a310.2tn by 2050.\n\nBut what\u2019s so infuriating is that it refuses to consider a whole host of other options to fund our economic transformation. A wealth tax \u2013 of 1% on the richest 1% \u2013 could, according to University of Greenwich estimates, bring in as much as \u00a370bn. Instead, the Treasury currently supports the fossil fuel industry through tax breaks and subsidies to the tune of \u00a310bn a year \u2013 a figure that any climate-friendly Labour government should surely slash.\n\nConversely, the cost of failing to do so should focus attention. David Cameron\u2019s decision a decade ago to \u201ccut the green crap\u201d, which ended up adding \u00a3150 annually to every household\u2019s energy bill, should be seared on the minds of climate ditherers.\n\nBut it would be shortsighted to suggest Labour\u2019s current absence of vision is purely down to economics. Its commitment to issue no new oil and gas licences is indeed welcome \u2013 but the revelation that a Labour government would not revoke the Rosebank oilfield licence (if approved by the Tories as expected in the coming days) is a tacit endorsement of this climate crime.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just any oilfield, but the largest undeveloped field in the North Sea, set to produce 200m tonnes of CO2, totalling more than the combined annual CO2 emissions of the 28 lowest-income countries. First oil is not expected until between 2026 and 2028, and investors are still assessing whether to press ahead \u2013 so why is Labour not making it crystal clear to them that they should not? By stubbornly refusing to revoke, Starmer has effectively given this project the green light himself.\n\nFrom abolishing tuition fees, to adopting rent controls, to offering free school meals for primary children, Starmer has been hamstrung by his own arbitrary fiscal rules, fear of rightwing press backlash, and a tribal determination to take control from rival party factions. The clear, radical and modern vision for Britain is nowhere to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, people are shifting from desperation to \u2013 as the Guardian\u2019s John Harris put it recently \u2013 \u201ca widespread sense of fatalistic hopelessness\u201d. The conditions are now ripe for the extreme right to continue apace with efforts to seize the narrative and control the political agenda.\n\nSo technocratic tinkering and over-cautious managerialism won\u2019t deliver urgently needed change, or the hope that comes from inspirational leadership. But a radically transformative vision will. That means ditching fossil fuels for good to deliver abundant, affordable energy; creating millions of skilled and stable green jobs, paying a fair and decent wage; a zero-carbon economy that redistributes wealth to those on the lowest incomes; and investing in public \u2013 not private \u2013 services to protect our health, power cheap and clean transport, restore our natural environment and enrich our lives. The moment to set out that vision and deliver it is now.",

            "text": "While conservative parties in the US, Australia and Canada have allowed opponents of action on climate change to help define their politics, thankfully in Britain successive Tory prime ministers have pushed such views to the fringes of their party. In 1989, Margaret Thatcher became the first world leader to warn the UN of the climate threat. Three decades later, as Theresa May opted to make Britain the first country to put into law the net zero goal of the Paris agreement, not one of her MPs voted against it. Apart from a brief wobble in 2013 when David Cameron, who had told voters \u201cvote blue, go green\u201d and went on to declare \u201ccut the green crap\u201d, this country has enjoyed a remarkable, and very welcome, degree of cross-party unity on the need to decarbonise.\n\nEnabled by this consensus, a boom in offshore wind energy has allowed Britain to rapidly phase out coal use, have some of the cleanest electricity of any country and create thousands of jobs. Last winter, it also kept the lights on as the continent scrambled to find alternatives to expensive gas imports after Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nFor all his other faults, Boris Johnson knew voters wanted more ambitious steps to reach climate safety. He put net zero on page one of his winning manifesto. In office, he prioritised new policies to cut carbon pollution, including a law to end the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030. He offered grants to households to incentivise cleaner heating technologies to replace gas boilers, and doubled down on efforts by Michael Gove to attach green strings to farm subsidies after Brexit.\n\nSo it is alarming that a series of developments last week suggest Rishi Sunak may be preparing to break with this decades-long consensus in pursuit of a dividing line with Labour ahead of the looming general election. On Wednesday, the government\u2019s official independent advisers on climate change, led by the former environment secretary, Lord Deben, issued a damning report saying their confidence that Britain would achieve its carbon targets had \u201cmarkedly declined\u201d since Sunak took office. On Thursday, May made a rare intervention in a speech to Britain\u2019s clean tech sector, warning: \u201cWhere the UK once led, we are now falling behind.\u201d\n\nWhen he set out his top five priorities for office, climate action was notable by its absence\n\nOn Friday, Zac Goldsmith \u2013 the environmentalist whom Cameron brought into parliament to symbolise the modernisation of his party \u2013 resigned, citing Sunak\u2019s uninterest in the planet. His letter of resignation revealed that the prime minister had secretly abandoned promises he made to world leaders only last year to channel billions to poorer countries to help them deal with worsening extreme weather events.\n\nEven before last week, the signs were there that Sunak lacks commitment to environmental progress. When he set out his top five priorities for office, climate action was notable by its absence. It was only when this newspaper revealed that Johnson would attend last year\u2019s UN climate talks that Sunak U-turned on his refusal to turn up, despite the attendance of other G7 leaders.\n\nWeeks later, he nodded through the first deep coalmine in Britain for 30 years. Despite a rebellion from dozens of his MPs who sought to lift the ban on new onshore windfarms in the face of the energy security crisis sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, he has done nothing to unleash this cheap and secure source of energy.\n\nIt is just one of the many recommendations of a review by Number 10\u2019s own climate tsar, Chris Skidmore, that he has chosen not to adopt. He also axed a crucial cross-Whitehall climate committee that Johnson had set up to steer policymaking.\n\nIt can be no surprise that more moderate one nation backbenchers are raising their concerns with the cabinet that Sunak seems to be abandoning the centre ground on green issues. They are correctly diagnosing that these decisions raise questions beyond those of his personal commitment to cutting carbon. They cast doubt over his broader economic and political judgment.\n\nDuring the Conservative leadership contest, Will Tanner, now Sunak\u2019s deputy chief of staff, wrote a report for the thinktank Onward with data showing that a rowback on climate ambition could cost the Tories more than a million votes. Poll after poll shows environmental concerns are among the public\u2019s top priorities.\n\nThis suggests people appreciate how the transition to green offers huge economic opportunities, which can drive the growth we so badly need to improve our creaking public services. Despite the economic boost on offer from Britain\u2019s comparative advantage in many of these sectors \u2013 born of our windy location, our world-leading engineering sector and our top universities and financial services industries \u2013 analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) shows that Britain is investing far less in green technologies than either Germany or France.\n\nWith China dominating markets in solar power and battery technologies, and Biden investing a trillion dollars to help the US catch up, a global race is on to lead the way in building the future. Yet Sunak seems content to see Britain left behind. For what? So he and his ministers can deploy cheap jibes to try to characterise Labour as being in hock to Just Stop Oil militants? Or is he simply too weak to stand up to out-of-touch rightwingers such as David Frost, Kemi Badenoch and Suella Braverman?\n\nThe prime minister will have the opportunity to correct his course when his energy bill returns to the Commons. He should back proposals from Skidmore and opposition parties to unblock onshore wind and solar energy, block new coalmines and restore the climate consensus our security and prosperity demand.",

            "text": "Last year, the renowned climate scientist Maisa Rojas, 50, left her academic comfort zone and took the post of Chilean environment minister in the progressive leftwing government of Gabriel Boric. The physics associate professor with an Oxford doctorate was one of many bold appointments in a cabinet that promised to promote ecological and feminist values, social justice and devolution. With Chile suffering prolonged fires, droughts and heatwaves, she has helped the country pass a climate law and a nature law to protect biodiversity.\n\nYou are one of the leading scientists in Chile. Why did you enter politics? Is it true that you got involved after the first round of the presidential election, when it seemed that a conservative climate denier, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, might take power?\n\nYes, that definitely was a big part of it. I really, really felt that in this critical decade, when climate actions need to be an urgent priority, we could not afford to have a climate denier as president of our country.\n\nFrom your experience of the past year, do you think it would be a good idea to have more highly qualified scientists in government positions?\n\nI asked the same question when I was appointed. Of course I hope to make a difference, but there is no guarantee because you have to understand that in politics, you don\u2019t only take decisions based on evidence and science. You need a lot of other abilities, not just understanding the main subjects. You have to figure out a much more complex ecosystem. I am still figuring it out.\n\nIf we did not have so many social inequalities, we would not have the same level of environmental degradation\n\nAfter a year\u2019s experience on the inside, do you feel government institutions \u2013 most of which were established in the very different climate of the 19th and 20th centuries \u2013 are equipped to deal with the scale of the emergency we face?\n\nThey are not. That is one of the big challenges. I have had to make that very clear. In the case of Chile, we have had, since last year, a climate change law. It is a framework law that has two objectives: carbon neutrality at the latest by 2050 and building resilience against the worst effects of climate change. This involved 17 of our 24 ministries, so I can tell you it will be quite a challenge to implement this because it requires coordination and tranversation of this subject across the whole of government.\n\nThis morning, I was at a meeting between the ministry of energy and the ministry of transport, where they were telling the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] how the law was being implemented. What they have realised is that they must put a climate change lens on everything they do. That requires new laws because the old ones have contradictions. It is fascinating to see how this is going, and quite exciting.\n\nYour appointment as minister appears to be tied up with a generational and gender change that is happening in Chile and many other countries. How is that linked to the rise in environmental consciousness?\n\nI am not so young any more, but about the gender part, I think they are quite interrelated because in my view the climate crisis, the loss of biodiversity crisis and the pollution crisis are ultimately a relationship crisis. It is the result of a bad relationship with nature, but also among ourselves, that has been propelled by social inequalities. If our world did not have these social inequalities, I am sure we would not have the same level of environmental degradation because no one who has access to education, to money, to power would accept to live in an area that was so degraded.\n\nThat is true in the world as a whole, between the global north and the global south. And it is true inside society. Gender inequality is one of the most obvious inequalities we have. In western societies, caring is done by women at home who look after children, the elderly, etc. What we need is a society that takes more care. What is the easiest way to do that? Bring women into public life.\n\nInside the government, how powerful is the environment ministry? In many countries, the environment minister is little more than a decoration used to greenwash the administration. Do you have the power you need to make the changes that are required?\n\nI have a mandate to be part of the first ecological, feminist government of Chile, and to pursue a just transition and decentralisation. Those were our four campaign promises. We must put content in how to materialise an ecological government, how to change the model of development from something that is destructive and based on raw materials. I think I play an important role in that. I sit at the table for national strategy. I have the climate change law, which aims for net zero by 2050.\n\nMaisa Rojas speaking at the Cop27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, November 2022. Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP\n\nThis ministry plays an important role in making sure the energy transition occurs. I also take care of biodiversity and have to ensure that our climate solutions do not deepen the biodiversity crisis. This ministry started in 2010 so it is relatively new. I want to leave this ministry stronger and pave the road for these transitions with a strong basis so they cannot be overthrown by whoever follows us in government. I have the backing of the president for that.\n\nChile\u2019s economy has long depended on mining. How do you change that extractive mindset and balance it with the needs of biodiversity? I guess there must be times when the president says to you: \u201cGo easy on that, we need the money\u201d?\n\nYes, that is the most complicated part. That is where things become muddy. These are really the tough questions. To demonstrate that we can do both \u2013 develop the economy while taking care of our environment \u2013 at the necessary velocity. That is really the challenge.\n\nIn the case of mining, we need a common understanding of what needs to be done. We have had conversations about sustainable mining and green mining. And I have said I prefer not to talk in those terms, which sound like greenwashing because mining is never sustainable. We need to talk about responsible mining. We know mining has important, irreversible impacts on nature. We need a broad agreement about what impacts we are willing to take \u2013 and to be responsible about that.\n\nYou have said Chile can be a climate leader. How? Many countries have made net zero targets. What can you do in concrete terms that sets an example for others and puts us on the path for a better world?\n\nThere are a lot of pledges to be net zero by 2050, but not many countries are actually doing that. Before I leave I\u2019d like to see the transition in what is left of this decade. That is when the challenges are. It is my firm conviction that if Chile really wants to be a developed country and to improve the wellbeing of our people then we must be the first to do the green transition and not the last.\n\nMany developing countries say they need more time, that they don\u2019t have the capacity, that they want to develop first. I think that is wrong. We improve the lives of our citizens if we are first. Otherwise, we will just have tons of stranded assets that will hold back development for a long time. A just transition will have many benefits \u2013 cleaner cities, longer life expectancy, better air, better soil, decontaminated rivers and more beauty. That is why we must do this as quick as we can. We still need help. But if a small developing country like Chile can do this, it will be an important example to many other countries.",

            "text": "The world is shifting towards a superheated climate not seen in the past 1m years, prior to human existence, because \u201cwe are damned fools\u201d for not acting upon warnings over the climate crisis, according to James Hansen, the US scientist who alerted the world to the greenhouse effect in the 1980s.\n\nHansen, whose testimony to the US Senate in 1988 is cited as the first high-profile revelation of global heating, warned in a statement with two other scientists that the world was moving towards a \u201cnew climate frontier\u201d with temperatures higher than at any point over the past million years, bringing impacts such as stronger storms, heatwaves and droughts.\n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since mass industrialization, causing a 20% chance of having the sort of extreme summer temperatures currently seen in many parts of the northern hemisphere, up from a 1% chance 50 years ago, Hansen said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more in the pipeline, unless we reduce the greenhouse gas amounts,\u201d Hansen, who is 82, told the Guardian. \u201cThese superstorms are a taste of the storms of my grandchildren. We are headed wittingly into the new reality \u2013 we knew it was coming.\u201d\n\nHansen was a Nasa climate scientist when he warned lawmakers of growing global heating and has since taken part in protests alongside activists to decry the lack of action to reduce planet-heating emissions in the decades since.\n\nJames Hansen: \u2018There\u2019s a lot more in the pipeline, unless we reduce the greenhouse gas amounts.\u2019 Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nHe said the record heatwaves that have roiled the US, Europe, China and elsewhere in recent weeks have heightened \u201ca sense of disappointment that we scientists did not communicate more clearly and that we did not elect leaders capable of a more intelligent response\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt means we are damned fools,\u201d Hansen said of humanity\u2019s ponderous response to the climate crisis. \u201cWe have to taste it to believe it.\u201d\n\nThis year looks likely to be the hottest ever recorded globally, with the summer already seeing the hottest June and, possibly, hottest week ever reliably measured. Conversely, 2023 may in time be considered an average or even mild year, as temperatures continue to climb. \u201cThings will get worse before they get better,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cThis does not mean that the extreme heat at a particular place this year will recur and grow each year. Weather fluctuations move things around. But the global average temperature will go up and the climate dice will be more and more loaded, including more extreme events.\u201d\n\nHansen has argued in a new research paper, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, that the rate of global heating is accelerating, even when natural variations, such as the current El Ni\u00f1o climatic event that periodically raises temperatures, are accounted for. This is due to what he said was an \u201cunprecedented\u201d imbalance in the amount of energy coming into the planet from the sun versus the energy reflected away from Earth.\n\nWhile global temperatures are undoubtably climbing due to the burning of fossil fuels, scientists are divided over whether this rate is accelerating. \u201cWe see no evidence of what Jim is claiming,\u201d said Michael Mann, a University of Pennsylvania climate scientist who added that the heating of the climate system had been \u201cremarkably steady\u201d. Others said the idea was plausible, although more data was required to be certain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s maybe premature to say the warming is accelerating, but it\u2019s not decreasing, for sure. We still have our foot on the gas,\u201d said Matthew Huber, an expert in paleoclimatology at Purdue University.\n\nHansen testifies before a Senate subcommittee in 1989, a year after his history-making testimony telling the world that global warming was here and would get worse. Photograph: Dennis Cook/AP\n\nScientists have estimated, through reconstructions based on evidence gathered via ice cores, tree rings and sediment deposits, that the current surge in heating has already brought global temperatures to levels not seen on Earth since about 125,000 years ago, before the last ice age.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

Nothing is adapted to this.\u201d\n\nPrevious shifts in the climate, spurred by greenhouse gases or changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit, have caused changes to unfold over thousands of years. But as heatwaves strafe populations unused to extreme temperatures, forests burn and marine life struggles to cope with soaring ocean heat, the current upward spike is occurring at a pace not seen since the extinction of the dinosaurs 65m years ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the magnitude of change, it\u2019s the rate of change that\u2019s an issue,\u201d said Ellen Thomas, a Yale University scientist who studies climate over geologic timescales. \u201cWe have highways and railroads that are set in place, our infrastructure can\u2019t move. Almost all my colleagues have said that, in hindsight, we have underestimated the consequences. Things are moving faster than we thought, which is not good.\u201d\n\nThis summer\u2019s searing heat has fully revealed to the world a message that Hansen attempted to deliver 35 years ago and scientists have strived to convey since, according to Huber. \u201cWe have been staring this in the face as scientists for decades, but now the world is going through that same process, which is like the five stages of grief,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s painful to watch people go through it.\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t simply give up because the situation is dire,\u201d Huber added. \u201cWe need to say \u2018Here is where we need to invest and make changes and innovate\u2019 and not give up. We can\u2019t just write off billions of people.\u201d",

Another searing heatwave, in China, was made 50 times more likely by the climate crisis.\n\nThe results make it crystal clear that human-caused global heating is already destroying lives and livelihoods across the world, making the need to cut emissions ever more urgent. Such brutal heatwaves are no longer rare, the scientists said, and will worsen as emissions continue to rise. If the world heats by 2C, they will happen every two to five years.\n\nA report by leading climate scientists in March endorsed by the world\u2019s governments, said: \u201cThere is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.\u201d The latest analysis demonstrated how rapidly that window is closing.\n\nEarlier in July, temperature records were shattered in many places in southern Europe, the western US and Mexico and China, bringing heat-related deaths and wildfires. The first week of July saw the hottest global temperatures in history. The researchers found that greenhouse gas emissions made the heatwaves 2.5C hotter in Europe, 2C hotter in North America, and 1C hotter in China than if humankind had not changed the global atmosphere.\n\nPeople shielding their faces in the sun in Beijing, China last week. The country\u2019s recent heatwave was made 50 times more likely by global heating. Photograph: Jade Gao/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cSuch heatwaves are no longer rare and the most important thing is, these extremes kill people, particularly destroying the lives and livelihoods of the most vulnerable,\u201d said Dr Friederike Otto at Imperial College London, UK, who was part of the analysis team.\n\n\u201cPoliticians often claim that they care about normal people and poor people,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we did value people, it\u2019s pretty obvious what we need to do. I don\u2019t think stronger evidence has ever been presented for a scientific question.\u201d\n\nOtto said it was \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d that governments agree to phase out fossil fuels at the UN climate summit Cop28, which opens on 30 November. The summit president, Sultan Al Jaber, is also the CEO of the state-run oil and gas company of the host nation, the United Arab Emirates. \u201cWe still have time to secure a safe and healthy future,\u201d said Otto. \u201cIf we do not, tens of thousands of people will keep dying from heat-related causes each year.\u201d\n\nJulie Arrighi, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: \u201cExtreme heat is deadly and rapidly on the rise.\u201d She said it was crucial for countries to act to protect people from heat. In the UK last week, the government\u2019s adaptation plan was called \u201cvery weak\u201d by experts. On Monday, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, indicated he may delay or abandon some green policies under pressure from the right wing of his party.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

More than 500 extreme weather events have now been analysed by scientists, who found 93% of heatwaves and 68% of droughts had been made more severe and/or more likely by human-caused emissions.\n\nMore than 61,000 people died in the European heatwaves of 2022, according to a recent study, including more than 3,000 in the UK. Another study estimated that millions have died from heat across the world in the past three decades because of the climate crisis. However, global progress to cut the burning of fossil fuels remains very slow, with the G20 the latest group to have such plans stymied by the opposition of fossil fuel states led by Saudi Arabia on Saturday.\n\n00:03:10 What is supercharging the global heat? \u2013 video explainer\n\nThe new analysis by the World Weather Attribution group used peer-reviewed methods to quantify the impact of the climate crisis on the recent heatwaves. They used weather data up to 18 July and computer models to compare today\u2019s climate, with 1.2C of global heating, with the cooler climate of the late 1800s.\n\nThe study found the heatwaves in Europe and the US were, as an absolute minimum, made 950 and 4,400 times more likely by global heating \u2013 making it virtually certain that they were the result of human-caused emissions. In China, the heatwave was made 50 times more likely.\n\nIn today\u2019s hotter climate, these heatwaves are expected about every five years in China, every 10 years in Europe and 15 years in the US, but will happen ever more frequently as emissions continue to rise. The growing El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate phenomenon, probably added a little heat to the heatwaves, the scientists said, but global heating from burning fossil fuels was the main reason for their severity.\n\nGareth Redmond-King, at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit in the UK, said: \u201cAs we keep burning fossil fuels, we fuel ever worse climate impacts. It won\u2019t stop until we cut emissions to net zero. Politicians who attempt to delay [climate] measures are locking in more of these extremes.\u201d\n\nHelen Clarkson, CEO of the Climate Group, which works with 500 multinational companies, said: \u201cThe UK government rowing back on green policies is both astonishing, at a time when the impacts of climate change are getting worse, and economically irresponsible. Previous moves to scrap green policies [on home insulation] added at least \u00a32.5bn to the UK\u2019s energy bills during the cost of living crisis.\u201d",

            "text": "Over the past few decades, climate scientists have made huge strides in understanding the future climate. But after recent weeks of extreme heat and devastating floods it\u2019s clear that, although climate models have provided good information about overall rising temperatures, they can\u2019t be sure what level of destruction each notch on the thermometer will bring.\n\nClimate modelling is extremely complex, but its fundamentals rely on basic physics \u2013 X tonnes of emissions will bring Y increase in temperature, with some error bars. Supercomputers have been able to factor in shifts in land use that will change the reflectivity of the Earth\u2019s surface. Improved temperature records helped verify their findings.\n\nBut lately, leading researchers have made a painful confession: even their most sophisticated models can\u2019t yet foresee exactly how Earth systems will respond to those higher temperatures.\n\nThe influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says cranking up global temperature by half a degree will bring much more extreme weather, and it can be more often, more intense, or extended in duration \u2013 but exactly how much more, it can\u2019t precisely say.\n\nSo, for instance, we\u2019ve already had a global temperature rise of about 1.2C: that\u2019s in line with IPCC projections. Yet the panel couldn\u2019t warn us about the appalling heat dome that\u2019s been searing North America. I can\u2019t find heat domes mentioned in the bible of climate change, the IPCC report. This periodic report inevitably lags behind new science and \u2013 under pressure from some governments and industries, as well as a desire not to scaremonger \u2013 its pronouncements tend to be conservative.\n\nThe models also couldn\u2019t warn us accurately about the emergence of the heat trapped deep in the ocean, which soaks up 90% of the world\u2019s excess warmth. In the 35 years I covered the environment for the BBC, I recall speculation that the warmth could stay deep for decades, perhaps centuries \u2013 not that some of it would suddenly burst up to the surface off the coast of northern Britain.\n\nMajor uncertainties remain, too, over rainfall. Good information about the future of monsoon rain would be a godsend for farmers who rely upon it \u2013 not just in India but in southern China. Unfortunately, good information on precipitation is proving a bit tricky to find.\n\nThe macro models also failed to project the effect of current elevated temperatures on ice at both poles. The former IPCC chief, Prof Bob Watson, told me: \u201cI am very concerned. None of the observed changes so far (with a 1.2C temperature rise) are surprising. But they are more severe than we predicted 20 years ago, and more severe than the predictions of five years ago. We probably underestimated the consequences.\u201d\n\nThis is a massive admission. He added: \u201cScientists are only now starting to understand the response of large ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica \u2013 and it is very disturbing.\u201d\n\nProf Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey, told me a few months ago the latest science on ice melt was \u201ctruly scary\u201d.\n\n\u2018The US has considered itself less vulnerable. But tell that to people in Phoenix trapped under that heat dome.\u2019 Photograph: Matt York/AP\n\nWatson said at current rates the world would almost certainly exceed the agreed maximum temperature rise of 1.5-2C. We would be lucky to get away with 2.5C, he said. More likely, we\u2019re heading towards 3C.\n\nThat number positively frightens many climate scientists. But, as India starts stockpiling rice with a temperature rise of 1.2C, what useful advice can scientists offer for a 3C world? Just how bad will things be by then?\n\nShould holidaymakers avoid buying homes in Greece? China is vulnerable to extremes \u2013 how should its economy adapt? The US has considered itself less vulnerable. But tell that to New Yorkers choking on wildfire smoke, or people in Phoenix trapped under that heat dome.\n\nWhile immediate harm to people grabs the headlines, what\u2019s even more destructive could be the impact of heat and humidity on food production for an expanding population. A global shift towards a plant-based diet could halve the land and water used for agriculture \u2013 and halve the carbon emissions \u2013 but politicians fear angering voters by recommending a dietary shift.\n\nFacing all this gloom means we need imagineers as well as climatologists. Watson said civilisation will still exist in the future, but with much worse living conditions. But what sort of a degraded civilisation might that be? By then we may even have triggered some natural tipping points that could result in a massive release of trapped methane in the tundra \u2013 let\u2019s hope not.\n\nWhat we do know is that so far, the effects of heating the climate are sooner and worse than many scientists projected (in public at least). This has policy implications. The world has agreed to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, but the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, says rich countries should be aiming to squeeze the timetable to 2040. But what is the use of a net zero policy if it relies in part on planting trees that may shrivel in future drought or crackle in wildfire?\n\nTo make matters worse, climate heating is one thing on a list of huge environmental problems \u2013 including pollution of the air and water, destruction of wildlife habitats, overfishing, insect population declines, loss of birds, plastic pollution, nitrates, soil loss and more.\n\nWatson says we don\u2019t know how these phenomena will interact with each other, but he urges politicians to err on the side of caution, as the stakes are so very high. Every 0.1C warming matters, scientists say: 1.5C is better than 1.6C. That in turn is less bad than 1.7C.\n\nAs the barrage of bad news continues, all we can be certain of is that there are many climate surprises lying ahead of us. Governments, companies and individuals need to urgently squeeze down emissions to insulate ourselves as far as possible from what we may face.",

            "text": "\u201cVery unusual\u201d, \u201cworrying\u201d, \u201cterrifying\u201d, and \u201cbonkers\u201d; the reactions of veteran scientists to the sharp increase in north Atlantic surface temperatures over the past three months raises the question of whether the world\u2019s climate has entered a more erratic and dangerous phase with the onset of an El Ni\u00f1o event on top of human-made global heating.\n\nSince April, the warming appears to have entered a new trajectory. Meanwhile the area of global sea ice has dropped by more than 1 million sq km below the previous low.\n\n\u201cIf a few decades ago, some people might have thought climate change was a relatively slow-moving phenomenon, we are now witnessing our climate changing at a terrifying rate,\u201d said Prof Peter Stott, who leads the UK Met Office\u2019s climate monitoring and attribution team. \u201cAs the El Ni\u00f1o builds through the rest of this year, adding an extra oomph to the damaging effects of human-induced global heating, many millions of people across the planet and many diverse ecosystems are going to face extraordinary challenges and unfortunately suffer great damage.\u201d\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern emerges when normal easterly winds weaken and warm water spreads across the whole Pacific.\n\nThe immediate impact is on marine life which is unaccustomed to waters that have warmed by several degrees in some areas. More worrying still, the extra energy in the ocean, which is the world\u2019s biggest heat absorber, may bring fiercer-than-usual storms, more destructive rain dumps and longer, hotter heatwaves.\n\nWhen the extremes in the north Atlantic started to be registered in April, the hope was that this would prove a temporary blip. In May, however, the average temperature in the region was the highest since records began in 1850. On 12 June, the climatologist Brian McNoldy stirred up a Twitter storm by calculating that, based on past data, there was a one in 256,0000 chance of this happening.\n\nThis anomaly prompted some commentators to wonder if something unforeseen \u2013 a black swan event \u2013 was taking place in the climate system. Calmer heads explained that it was more likely the result of El Ni\u00f1o and other natural factors being amplified by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars, factories and forest clearance.\n\nMichael Mann, the presidential distinguished professor at the University of Pennsylvania, warned against \u201ccherry picking\u201d one set of data from one region over a relatively short period of time. It was more important, he said, to focus on the bigger picture: that burning fossil fuels was leading to more powerful and destructive hurricanes as well as providing the energy in the atmosphere to fuel extreme weather events, such as droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and floods. \u201cWe need to step back and look at the big picture. And it is alarming. The truth,\u201d Mann said, \u201cis bad enough.\u201d\n\nKatharine Hayhoe, the chief scientist with the Nature Conservancy and distinguished professor at Texas Tech University, said the north Atlantic temperature anomaly was the result of long-term loading of the climate system by 380 zeta joules of extra heat from human emissions of heat-trapping gases. \u201cNearly 90% of it has been going into the ocean; and it\u2019s that gradual but inexorable increase in ocean heat content over time scales of decades rather than years that most worries climate scientists,\u201d she said.\n\nAround Ireland and the UK, coastal waters have been several degrees warmer than average for the time of year. Storms are now forming in the Atlantic earlier than normal, almost certainly as a result of the extra energy that is building up in the surface layer of the ocean. For the first time in June, there have been two simultaneous named tropical storms in the Atlantic, Bret and Cindy.\n\nHowever, rather than seeing the north Atlantic spike as a one-off event, Richard Betts, the head of the climate impacts division at the Met Office\u2019s Hadley Centre in Exeter said: \u201cWe can expect this kind of event to happen more often \u2013 which of course is a major cause for concern. For me, these graphs [of Atlantic surface temperature and Antarctic sea ice] are like yet another hammer blow driving home the urgency of the climate situation we are now in.\u201d\n\nWhile human emissions and El Ni\u00f1o are likely to be the two main drivers of the north Atlantic spike, Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist with the Breakthrough Institute, said more time was needed to disentangle other possible contributing factors, such as this year\u2019s unusual dearth in Saharan dust levels, the large amount of stratospheric water vapour, the slowing of ocean circulation and the increasing frequency of El Ni\u00f1o events.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

Carlos Nobre, who is one of Brazil\u2019s top climate scientists, said there was a 60% chance that this year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o would be a strong one. This would be \u201cvery very worrying\u201d for the Amazon rainforest, which sustained some of its worst degradation during 2015-16, when an El Ni\u00f1o event caused the dry season to become longer and left the vegetation more vulnerable to fire.\n\nElsewhere in the world, the latest El Ni\u00f1o is already causing misery. In Mexico, several cities have recently broken the record for their hottest days ever, including Chihuahua, Nuevo Laredo and Monclova. Many cities in Texas are sweltering in their worst-ever heatwaves. The same is true in China, where more than 20 cities, including Shandong, Tianjin and Huairou have registered new peaks. In Europe, the Austrian town of Oberndorf sweltered in a freakishly hot midnight temperature of 36.1C, one of the continent\u2019s highest-ever nighttime temperatures. In the Middle East, people are used to heat but they can normally expect some respite at high altitudes. That was not the case in Iran last week, when the temperature in Saravan hit 45C \u2013 one of the hottest days ever recorded at an elevation of more than 1,000m.\n\nMany things are still uncertain. Scientists will not know for a couple of months how severe El Ni\u00f1o will be. Its wind-sheering effect could inhibit storm formation and help to balance out the pressure of the sea-level temperature. The north Atlantic heat spike is already showing signs that it may fade.\n\nBut there is no doubt among scientists that things will continue to get worse as long as greenhouse gases continue to rise and natural climate stabilisers, such as the Amazon, continue to be cut down.\n\nHayhoe said the trends made her feel \u201ceven more concerned and even more motivated to ensure I\u2019m doing everything I can to help people understand the profound risks climate change poses to them and how each of us can be a powerful advocate for climate action\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel sad and anxious,\u201d said Stott. \u201cSad for the level of environmental destruction going on around the world, including the continuing destruction of the Amazon rainforest. And anxious for how people are going to cope if this carries on much longer, not just in far-away places that are already very hot and dry, but here in the UK where fires, flash floods and droughts are getting more and more frequent and intense. It isn\u2019t a secure and sustaining future to look forward to. I still hope a turning point can be reached such that greenhouse gas emissions do start to reduce rapidly. And I know that this can be done without devastating our quality of life, quite the opposite in fact.\u201d",

            "text": "As temperatures in the Chinese capital are forecast to creep back up to record-breaking heights this weekend, activists are hoping that overheated Beijingers will start thinking about the causes of, as well as the solutions to, such intense heatwaves.\n\nLast weekend the mercury soared past 40C (104F) for three consecutive days, the first time that the city has endured such prolonged heat since its weather station started recording temperatures in 1951. Surrounding areas also issued \u201cred\u201d weather warnings, indicating that the temperature could surpass 40C within 24 hours.\n\nWhile social media is flooded with hacks for keeping cool, such as eating cold noodles and sporting a \u201cBeijing bikini\u201d, some Chinese people are yet to connect the extreme heat with the climate crisis, something activists want to change. But with obstacles from the government in the form of censorship and a clampdown on civil society, spurring action is difficult.\n\nGlobal warming is causing more frequent and intense heatwaves across the region. A study published in May found that climate change was responsible for heatwaves being at least 2C hotter in other parts of Asia.\n\n\u201cPeople are becoming more aware of the severity of heatwaves, but not the link between heatwaves and climate change,\u201d says Zhao Li, a senior researcher for Greenpeace east Asia\u2019s Beijing office.\n\nA woman shelters under her jacket during hot weather conditions in Beijing Photograph: Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThat is partly because, although there is some limited education about climate change, permitted discourse stops short of talking about major policy shifts, such as reducing China\u2019s coal emissions more rapidly. The government has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060, but concerns about energy security and the need for economic growth mean that local authorities are showing no sign of backing down on building new coal power.\n\nAlso, says Zhao, \u201ceven if people link heatwaves and climate change, they don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that the individual should pay attention to.\u201d Most people see it as being the government\u2019s responsibility \u2013 and therefore out of the hands of the public, she says.\n\nStill, awareness of climate change, and discussion about how it can be managed, is ticking up. The topic is increasingly discussed in state media. Analysis by Sixth Tone, a state-backed outlet, found that mentions of key words relating to climate change jumped from about 750,000 in 2019 to nearly 3.3m in 2021.\n\nSurveys suggest that, compared with the US, a slightly higher proportion of Chinese people accept that climate change is happening and that it is caused by human activity.\n\nBut as in the west, activists often find that appealing to people\u2019s personal needs is more effective in changing behaviour than abstract arguments. Feng Jing is the founder of Road to Tomorrow, a Shanghai-based group that promotes sustainability through the lens of healthy eating, such as by encouraging people to eat less meat and more local produce. \u201cFood is easy to understand, and then you can make connections with your health and the health of the planet,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cChanging [behaviour] is always very hard. It takes a long time to convince people,\u201d Feng says. She believes that China is still in the raising awareness phase of climate consciousness, rather than taking action.\n\n\u2018People are getting used to the words \u201cclimate change\u201d\u2019\n\nIn 2019, Shanghai became the first city in China to introduce mandatory recycling. Several other cities, including Beijing, soon followed suit. State media claims that more than 90% of Shanghai households are compliant with the new regime. But as with most green initiatives, the directive came from above rather than a grassroots movement.\n\nOne area in which people are choosing eco-friendly options without a government mandate is electric vehicles. One in four cars sold in China last year was an EV, compared with 6% in the US.\n\nPrevious extreme weather events, especially when they have affected the lives of Beijingers, have prompted public discussion that has contributed to policy changes.\n\nIn the early 2010s, Beijing and other big cities were frequently shrouded in thick cloaks of pollution, referred to as \u201cairpocalypses\u201d. With the problem becoming increasingly impossible to ignore, in 2013 the government declared \u201cwar on pollution\u201d, requiring urban areas to reduce particulate matter pollution by as much as 25% in the next four years. By 2017 the concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing had fallen by more than 35%, according to the city\u2019s monitoring centre.\n\nBut the connection between global warming and extreme weather events such as the recent heatwaves can still feel abstract, says Feng. \u201cPeople are getting used to the words \u2018climate change\u2019 now \u2026 but it\u2019s still hard for them to make connections, what will this mean for my life, how will it affect me\u201d.\n\nDespite the increasing awareness of the concept of climate change, activists who stray beyond suggesting tweaks to personal behaviour often encounter the ire of the authorities. In 2019, China\u2019s first \u201cschool striker\u201d for the climate, Ou Hongyi, was repeatedly harassed after staging a Greta Thunberg-inspired protest outside government offices in Guilin, her home city in south China. In 2021, Li Genshan, an activist in Ningxia, was sentenced to more than four years in prison after protesting against wastewater pollution.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese general public has a feeling of powerlessness,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cNo matter whether it\u2019s on climate change issues or economic issues\u201d.",

            "publish_date": "2023-07-22T00:00:00",
            "text": "Do \u201ctree huggers\u201d have a place in Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party? After the party\u2019s failure to take Boris Johnson\u2019s former seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in Thursday\u2019s byelection, the Labour leader\u2019s commitment to green policies has been called into question.\n\nEarlier this month, the Sunday Times reported that Starmer has grown so frustrated with green policies \u2013 which the Tories are accused of having \u201cweaponised\u201d to spark a culture war over the environment \u2013 that he declared: \u201cI hate tree huggers.\u201d\n\nLabour insiders rushed to say this was not true, and pointed to the recent launch of a number of green measures, including a halt to new North Sea oil and gas licences; decarbonising the energy system by 2030; and \u00a328bn a year for green investment, though this was postponed to the second half of the next parliament instead of the start.\n\nThe Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection, which Labour failed to win by just 495 votes, has revived concerns. Uxbridge is one of the most car-dependent constituencies in the country, and Labour\u2019s London mayor Sadiq Khan is about to introduce an extension to the ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez) that would penalise the area\u2019s most polluting vehicles in an attempt to clean up the capital\u2019s filthy air.\n\nStarmer blamed Labour\u2019s failure to take the seat it was keenly targeting on the anti-pollution policy. He told journalists: \u201cUlez was the reason we didn\u2019t win there yesterday. We know that. We heard that on the doors. And we\u2019ve all got to reflect on that, including the mayor.\u201d\n\nAsked what \u201creflect\u201d meant and whether Ulez should be scrapped, Starmer refused to defend the policy. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look at the result. The mayor needs to reflect. And it\u2019s too early to say what should happen next.\u201d\n\nTom Burke, the co-founder of the green thinktank E3G, predicted that those within Labour who are antagonistic to green measures will seize this moment. He said: \u201cThere will be pressure inside Labour \u2013 some people will take fright from this.\u201d Some trade unions have deep reservations about the transition to a low-carbon economy, and some in the party are fearful over Tory attacks on climate policies.\n\nBut Burke warned that Starmer should not listen to these concerns. He said: \u201cThey should be very careful in generalising from this to climate policy more generally. What Starmer should do is not attack his own side, but communicate far more effectively what the consequences will be of climate policy failure. That\u2019s what\u2019s missing from this debate.\u201d\n\nInsiders said there would be no change to Labour\u2019s green stance. A Labour source said that green policies such as ramping up renewable energy and home insulation were the way to bring down soaring bills. The source added: \u201cIt\u2019s full steam ahead on policies that tackle the climate crisis and the cost of living, as they can only be tackled together \u2013 that\u2019s the only way.\u201d\n\nDoug Parr, the chief scientist and policy director at Greenpeace UK, said that is the right response. He explained: \u201cThe worst and most regressive take would be that this shows green policy is unpopular. We know that people are crying out for action on climate and nature, and it needs visionary and fair policy to make it happen.\n\n\u201cFar from retreating, they need to go further and faster and ensure that measures are in place for ensuring the burden of change does not fall on those with the least resources.\u201d\n\nThe local problem of the Ulez is also likely to dissipate. Khan\u2019s team said it would still come into force at the end of August, and small businesses and those receiving child benefit will get financial help to scrap the most polluting vehicles. They hope that the onset of the scheme will dispel damaging myths over who will be affected, and help people to realise the benefits of cleaner air.\n\nWhat is clear is that Starmer can expect many more attacks from the Tories on green grounds. Labour insiders alleged that the Tory campaign in Uxbridge was fought with \u201cdirty tricks\u201d, with voters being misled over the impact of Ulez. They say many voters were given the mistaken impression that they would lose the right to use their cars, when in fact only one in 10 people will be affected. In one case, a driver of a Tesla electric car berated Labour canvassers on the doorstep, fearing he would face restrictions, based on Tory campaigning.\n\nIt seems unlikely there will be any letup in the Tory climate culture war, however, now that the Uxbridge campaign has borne such fruit. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, has been stepping up his attacks on Labour, branding the party \u201cthe political wing of Just Stop Oil\u201d. He wrote to Starmer this week to demand Labour pay compensation for damage caused by the group\u2019s protesters.\n\nBurke was scathing about these tactics. He said: \u201cWhenever you see politicians being rude like this, it means they really don\u2019t know what to say about how to square the divisions inside their own party on the issue. These Tory attacks are increasingly ridiculous, and they are misleading themselves about what the public think.\u201d",

            "text": "Queer members of Just Stop Oil issued Pride in London with a set of demands this week, arguing that \u201cthe climate crisis is the biggest threat to LGBTQ+ rights, due to social collapse\u201d. This comes after Pride faced accusations of \u201cpinkwashing\u201d over its decision to make United Airlines the headline sponsor of this year\u2019s event.\n\nJust Stop Oil is calling for transparency around which companies Pride in London accepts money from, and how these decisions are made; a statement from the organisers demanding an end to new oil and gas; and a public meeting with its volunteers about joining the fight for climate justice. Failure to meet these demands, Just Stop Oil suggested, \u201cmay or may not\u201d result in protest action during Saturday\u2019s event.\n\nPride is not alone in facing this kind of criticism: in June, the British LGBT Awards saw a number of public figures pull out of the event in protest at its partnership with Shell and BP. Rather than coming out of nowhere, Just Stop Oil\u2019s actions are part of a larger wave of activism that aims to forge a greater connection between the LGBTQ+ movement and the struggle for climate justice. Activist group Fossil Free Pride, for example, has been steadily campaigning for Pride events to refuse partnerships with environmentally destructive companies.\n\nI am behind Just Stop Oil\u2019s intervention, partly because it is dramatic and a little messy \u2013 there\u2019s a kind of supervillain campness to it issuing a public ultimatum against a ticking clock. But it would be safe to say that not everyone found it so charming. The demand inspired furious accusations of homophobia; chortling from the right about \u201cthe wokes tearing each other apart\u201d; and the articulation of a well founded concern \u2013 at a time when homophobic and transphobic sentiments are resurgent, with an attendant increase in physical violence, is targeting an LGBTQ+ event just throwing more fuel on the fire?\n\nI have some sympathy with this view, but protesting against a specific LGBTQ+ organisation is not the same thing as attacking the community as a whole. Following Pride in London\u2019s racism scandal in 2021, it is hard to think of it as a cherished institution that automatically commands our loyalty.\n\nWhile some people have objected to the very notion of protesting against a Pride event, there is a long history of activists doing so, often in extremely catty ways: in the late 1990s and early 2000s, in the US the Gay Shame movement would host sarcastic award ceremonies, dishing out prizes in categories such as Exploiting Our Youth, Making More Queers Homeless and Best Racist-Ass Whites-Only Space. More recently, in 2017, five queer activists were arrested after protesting against the police presence at Glasgow Pride. Regardless of how hostile the current climate may be, protesting against a Pride event is not inherently reactionary, and LGBTQ+ institutions should not be considered above critique.\n\nIn the backlash against Just Stop Oil\u2019s announcement, one argument has cropped up repeatedly: LGBTQ+ rights and climate change are separate issues, and it\u2019s therefore inappropriate for environmental activists to conflate the two. In other words, Just Stop Oil should stick to its movement. This idea \u2013 that LGBTQ+ rights can be neatly cordoned off from other forms of political struggle \u2013 is an enduring one, but it\u2019s at odds with the original vision of gay liberation and the spirit of the protests Pride is intended to commemorate.\n\nStonewall was a riot, as the cliche goes, but rather than being a spontaneous uprising, it was driven \u2013 at least in part \u2013 by committed activists who were already involved in different movements. In the 1970s, groups such as the Gay Liberation Front and Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (Star) were firmly internationalist and multidimensional in their approaches, committed to opposing racism, colonialism and oppression in all its forms. By fighting for climate justice, today\u2019s queer activists are reclaiming this inheritance.\n\nIt should go without saying that the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people is inseparable from the climate crisis, which is coming for us all, regardless of our sexuality or gender identity. Research also suggests that marginalised members of society \u2013 particularly those who experience poverty, insecure housing and discrimination \u2013 will be disproportionately vulnerable to its effects.\n\nWe can see this playing out already: studies have shown that transwomen are at greater risk during environmental disasters, partly through being denied access to emergency shelters. If the LGBTQ+ movement wants to stand against oppression, we have to be acting in solidarity with people in the global south, where the effects of the climate crisis are already being experienced most dramatically.\n\nTo some extent, we can blame the climate crisis and today\u2019s anti-LGBTQ+ movement on the same forces. When you look at the history of \u201cdark money\u201d groups and hard-right thinktanks in the US, it is striking how many were formed in direct opposition to 1970s-era environmental regulations \u2013 along with lower corporate taxes, this was their biggest raison d\u2019etre. From that point onwards, homophobia and climate denial have been funded and promoted by the same institutions, the same media pundits, religious figures and politicians.\n\nAs the journalist Jane Mayer writes in her book Dark Money, the virulently homophobic Tea Party movement was funded by billionaires who, first and foremost, opposed Barack Obama\u2019s environmental and energy policies. This connection is as strong today as it\u2019s ever been, including here in the UK: thinktanks such as Policy Exchange, which has been enormously influential in pushing anti-trans narratives, has allegedly received funding from American donors with a track record of promoting climate denial. While marching in our parades, many fossil fuel companies are longtime supporters of the Conservative party and the Republicans, both of which have spent the last half decade agitating against trans people.\n\nThe climate crisis and the oppression of LGBTQ+ people are inextricable, not simply due to \u201cintersectionality\u201d as an abstract principle, but because they are rooted in the same ideologies and facilitated by the same people. Pride should be about marching, hand in hand, against those common enemies.",

            "text": "A European parliament plenary vote, held in mid-July, might normally pass under the radar of all but the most passionate aficionados of Brussels politics. That will not be the case next week, when environmental campaigners will watch through their fingers as one of the most consequential decisions so far is made in relation to the EU\u2019s net zero targets.\n\nBefore heading for their summer holidays, MEPs are expected to vote on a proposed nature restoration law, committing European governments to rehabilitate and rewild swathes of territory suffering from desertification, deforestation and the draining of peatlands. Along with action on pesticides, this is essentially the biodiversity strand to the EU\u2019s green deal. The law\u2019s role in facilitating carbon capture and creating healthy, resilient ecosystems is deemed indispensable by scientists, if emissions reduction targets are to be met. But as with other aspects of the green transition, Europe\u2019s increasingly dominant right is now mounting a sustained campaign to derail it.\n\nIn the context of post-Ukraine economic pressures and priorities, the European People\u2019s party (EPP) \u2013 which groups together centre-right parties \u2013 is arguing for a pause in environmental legislation. To that end, the EPP has allied with the climate-sceptic far right in Brussels, and is set to oppose the restoration law. As a result, next week\u2019s vote is on a knife edge. But the broader picture is still more disturbing.\n\nAmid concerns over the cost of living crisis, and a growing challenge from populist anti-green parties across Europe, mainstream conservatives are increasingly viewing opposition to the timetable and cost of the net zero transition as smart politics. In Germany, the extreme nationalists of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland are vying for second place in the polls, after leading attacks on government plans for the conversion of home heating systems to renewable energy. The centre-right Christian Democratic Union, which before the last election was contemplating coalition with the German Greens, is duly tacking in the same direction.\n\nIn Spain \u2013 where a snap election this month may see the far right enter government for the first time since the return of democracy \u2013 the high-profile conservative mayor of the Madrid region has accused the left of overstating the gravity of the climate crisis. Elsewhere, the rise of the Farmer-Citizen Movement in the Netherlands, which opposes attempts to reduce nitrogen emissions from intensive farming, has come to symbolise a potential rural backlash against net zero targets. Centre-right parties, for which agricultural regions are traditional strongholds, are rushing to represent the cause.\n\nThe world cannot afford for Europe to cool on its climate commitments. But as conservatives seek to turn the green deal into a dividing line, progressive leaders must respond to the threat where they have the power to do so. Much more needs to be done to persuade the less well-off and rural communities that they will be looked after in a time of upheaval. A renewed focus is needed on meaningful subsidies \u2013 for example, for homeowners switching to renewable forms of energy \u2013 and viable future pathways for those working in affected industries. Brussels\u2019 plan for a \u20ac87bn \u201csocial climate fund\u201d, due to be phased in from 2026, is nowhere near enough, given the scale and urgency of the task.\n\nA new age of economic and geopolitical insecurity has made a challenging transition even tougher. In the face of political headwinds, it will not be accomplished on the cheap.",

North Africa has seen temperatures near 50C (122F), with, in the Middle East, thousands suffering from unusually scorching heat during the hajj religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnd even Antarctica, currently in its winter, registered anomalously high temperatures, as glacier melt accelerates and the sun intensifies.

Global warming is also exacerbating crop losses and the spread of infectious diseases, as well as migration.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe extraction and use of coal, oil and gas harm people\u2019s health, are the primary driver of warming and are incompatible with a healthy climate future.

In Madrid, some nights are equatorial rather than tropical, as the temperature stays above 25C. June was the hottest month recorded on Earth for 120,000 years. The hottest week came early this month. \u201cVery dangerous long-duration heat\u201d, to use the language of the recent alert issued by the US National Weather Service in Arizona, sums up the experience of the last few weeks across much of the northern hemisphere. Extreme heat, wildfires and floods are ravaging parts of the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, India and China.\n\nGlobal heating is not the sole explanation for the hellish impact of Cerberus and Charon, the heatwaves named after mythical denizens of Hades.

But each time this natural and sporadic event recurs, typically adding 0.2C to the average global temperature, it heats up a planet that is already warmer than before as a result of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe hotter the Earth gets, the greater the danger of feedback loops and unanticipated events. In Europe, an established high pressure system in the south is currently trapping the region under a heat dome, and unusually high surface temperatures in the Mediterranean are helping to lock in the heat on land. With Cerberus, we have entered, according to the World Meteorological Organization, \u201cuncharted territory\u201d. As soon as this year or next year, say some scientists, global temperatures could breach the all-important 1.5C threshold prioritised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Loss of life, mass migration, crop losses and soaring food prices as a result of extreme weather are already a stark new reality. Worse is almost certainly to come.\n\nAt an intuitive level, we know this. But faced with these colossal and immediate challenges, European politics is showing alarming signs of drift. The aftermath of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis, and the spectre of economic recession, are combining to drain momentum from net zero targets. Last week, a core piece of the European Union\u2019s green deal was only passed by the narrowest of margins, after being heavily watered down. In key areas for reaching climate neutrality, such as transport, lifestyles and agriculture, progress is too slow.\n\nIn Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and elsewhere \u2013 as Gordon Brown has noted \u2013 the radical nationalist right is successfully turning the green agenda into a battleground for its culture wars. In Britain, it has become depressingly clear that the climate emergency is not a priority for Rishi Sunak. The Labour party has meanwhile revised the timetable of its potentially transformative \u00a328bn-a-year green transition plan.\n\nAfter so many IPCC reports, Cop summit communiques and political statements of intent, the idea that these heatwaves could be considered a wake-up call for Europe\u2019s governments and populations seems somewhat otiose. Cerberus and Charon are searing reminders that the climate emergency cannot be put on hold as other crises are addressed. Europe is heating faster than any other continent, but its politics is not keeping pace. Time really is running out; progressive politicians need to rediscover the courage of their convictions and a sense of urgency.",

            "text": "Rishi Sunak is facing mounting criticism for putting politics above the fight against climate change, amid clear signs that ministers are backtracking on plans to allow more onshore windfarms in England before a general election.\n\nThe Observer understands that a much-vaunted government consultation on ending what has in effect been a ban on new onshore wind projects will lead to a minimal relaxation of planning rules \u2013 because ministers do not want to anger potential Tory voters who oppose huge wind turbines in their neighbourhoods.\n\nOn Saturday night \u2013 as the Conservative party threatened to split over green policy \u2013 the former Tory environment secretary and outgoing chair of the climate change committee, Lord Deben, said it was simply unacceptable that the government was still discussing whether it was in favour of onshore wind or not when it was widely recognised as one of the cheapest forms of energy generation. The danger was also that UK industry would lose out in the resulting green industrial revolution for renewable energy to the US, China and the EU.\n\nDeben, who is retiring this weekend after 11 years as chair of the committee that officially advises government, told the Observer: \u201cIt is unacceptable to have spent so much time discussing something which should be immediate for government. Why we need to go through all this palaver [of consulting] I am not sure.\n\n\u201cIn effect we have stopped onshore wind. Having a basic opposition to it is just not a sensible thing.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Sunak was rocked by the resignation from the government of Tory peer and green enthusiast Zac Goldsmith, who said the prime minister was \u201csimply uninterested\u201d in the environment and the climate emergency.\n\nGoldsmith said in his resignation letter that the Tories would be punished by voters for the party\u2019s \u201capathy in the face of the greatest challenge we have faced\u201d and said his position had become untenable because of Sunak\u2019s lack of commitment.\n\nSunak countered shortly afterwards in a letter suggesting Goldsmith\u2019s departure had in fact been linked to No 10 asking him to apologise for having undermined the House of Commons privileges committee\u2019s inquiry into Boris Johnson and Partygate.\n\nThe former prime minister Theresa May also broke ranks against Sunak on climate policy last week, saying the UK was falling behind other countries and had been too slow to act in response to subsidies for green industries introduced by the US and the EU.\n\nWithout a clear response the UK was \u201cputting at risk its reputation as a leader in climate policy\u201d, May said.\n\nInstead of taking a lead on climate matters, Sunak and his ministers are, critics say, crudely trying to create a \u201cwedge issue\u201d with Labour over net zero policy in a general election, including attacking the opposition for its decision to oppose new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.\n\nRishi Sunak at the second Ashes Test match at Lord\u2019s on Saturday. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP\n\nTwo weeks ago energy secretary Grant Shapps accused Labour of becoming \u201cthe political wing of Just Stop Oil \u2013 and other eco-extremists who use ordinary people\u2019s lives as their weapon\u201d.\n\nWhile such comments will have pleased green sceptics on the Tory benches, they also angered Conservatives who believe their party is sacrificing responsible green policy to address a global emergency for what it believes will be short-term political gain. They fear they will suffer in blue wall seats unless their party is seen to have a credible and serious approach to tackling the climate crisis.\n\nAt a meeting last week of RenewableUK, a not-for-profit trade association representing the green industry, the Tory MP and former energy minister Chris Skidmore, who wrote a widely acclaimed report for the government on net zero strategy, made clear he disagreed fundamentally with Shapps\u2019s attack on Labour.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

Nobody wants to see disruption on our streets. It simply is not an extreme opinion to believe that one day we are going to have to end our use of fossil fuels,\u201d Skidmore said.\n\nSam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, which includes many dozens of Tory MPs, said it would be a mistake for the Conservatives to make oil and gas a dividing line, as if it did then oil and gas rather than green energy would become the main subject of debate. He added: \u201cThe Conservatives should focus on their positive message around renewable energy ahead of the election, which has been one of their greatest achievements in government.\u201d\n\nJames Robottom, head of onshore wind at RenewableUK, said there was now no expectation that ministers would make any significant changes to planning rules to allow more onshore wind projects in England as a result of its consultation.\n\nHe said his organisation was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by the evident lack of movement that was clear from suggestions made in the process, and the fact that there had been no response from government to the industry\u2019s views over the past three months. The result would be the loss of huge numbers of jobs and billions of pounds of domestic and overseas investment.\n\nEd Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for net zero, said: \u201cMainstream Conservatives are right to be alarmed by the climate failure and lurch towards a culture war on the part of Rishi Sunak and Grant Shapps.\n\n\u201cThe Tory leadership is way out of line with the British people, who do not want to see the consensus for climate and environmental action broken.\u201d\n\nRobottom said obstacles to new onshore wind development would \u201cseverely hinder investment in the onshore wind industry and its supply chain due to the high level of risk and uncertainty they create. We are being denied the opportunity for thousands of new jobs and billions in private investment in England.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEven if a few new projects will be able to get planning permission, it will be extremely difficult for them to source wind turbines, with markets in Germany, Scotland and elsewhere being far more attractive, and crucially with clear government backing and deployment targets.\u201d\n\nThe Department for Levelling Up said it had no statement to make on the planning rules consultation other than that it was ongoing and that it would take time to consider responses.\n\nNo 10 promised last year to dismantle the effective ban on onshore windfarms in England, which was put in place in 2015 by tightening planning restrictions in the national planning policy framework. However, after pressure from rightwing Tory MPs, the most that is now expected are modest changes that will do little to boost the number of English windfarms.\n\nThe former prime minister David Cameron brought in the de facto onshore wind ban in 2015 after coming under pressure from more than 100 Tory MPs. As a result just 16 new turbines were granted planning permission in England between 2016 and 2020 \u2013 a 96% drop on the previous five years.\n\nRecently the Guardian revealed that Ukraine had built more onshore wind turbines than England since it was occupied by Russian soldiers.\n\nOnly two onshore wind turbines have been installed in England since February last year, generating 1 megawatt (MW) of electricity in the Staffordshire village of Keele.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Tyligulska wind power plant, meanwhile \u2013 the first to be built in a conflict zone \u2013 has begun generating enough clean electricity to power about 200,000 homes just 60 miles from the frontline in the southern region of Mykolaiv, with 19 turbines providing an installed capacity of 114MW.",

            "text": "How to respond to the avalanche of record-breaking extreme weather and temperatures terrorising the planet? For many scientists it is a moment of genuine despair, but also a time to resist climate doomism.\n\nFor British tourists still flying to Greece while it is on fire, and a few holdout news organisations, the answer seems to be to look away or deflect. We shouldn\u2019t join them. Equally, as Michael Mann and Susan Joy Hassol have argued, there is no need to inflate the magnitude of what is happening. The reality is confronting enough.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what we know. Mediterranean Europe and northern Africa are burning. Wildfires in at least nine countries, particularly Greece, Algeria and Italy, are killing people and wrecking lives, livelihoods and nature. They follow historic blazes in Canada a few weeks ago.\n\nThere have been bad fires before, of course, but these have been exacerbated by what is almost certainly the hottest month on record due to the extreme northern summer.\n\nAcross the globe, the average temperature for most days in July has been hotter than any previous day that we know of. The list of records broken is itself unprecedented.\n\nA heat dome in the US south-west has pushed the temperature in Phoenix, Arizona, beyond 43C for 27 days straight. Beijing usually has 11 days a year hotter than 35C, but has already had 27 scorchers. If these trends continue this may be the hottest year on record.\n\nThat seems particularly likely for sea temperatures, where records have already been smashed.\n\nZeke Hausfather, a US-based climate scientist and writer, calculated that the heat in the northern Atlantic Ocean has now pushed beyond what climate models predicted. It suggests something extraordinary is happening in that part of the world. Similarly, the amount of sea ice around Antarctica continues to be far below previous record lows.\n\nBut Hausfather found for the planet as a whole \u2013 both on the land and sea surface \u2013 temperatures were within what most climate models projected, just at the hotter end of it. Put another way: this is not actually worse than we expected. It is the brutal reality of what scientists told us would happen.\n\nA quick study published this week by the World Weather Attribution group suggests the heatwaves over Europe, the US and China would have been virtually impossible without human interference \u2013 that is, our burning of fossil fuels. The researchers found the run of extreme heat in China had been made 50 times more likely by the carbon pollution we have collectively pumped out.\n\nThis is happening when the world is, on average, about 1.2C hotter than pre-industrial times. If the temperature rise hits 2C we can expect these brutal heat waves every two-to-five years.\n\nThe good news from scientists is that rapid action can still make a significant difference and limit future damage\n\nHeat waves often receive less immediate attention than fires, floods and cyclone, but they kill more people. A study found extreme heat killed more than 61,000 in Europe alone last year. Imagine the headlines if we knew about that in real time.\n\nCaveats are everywhere in science, and we need some here. Climate systems are complex, and there are a number of factors that could be helping inflate current temperatures. An obvious one is that, according to the World Meteorological Organization, the world has moved into an El Ni\u00f1o event, which generally makes it hotter. The last El Ni\u00f1o in 2016 was, for now, the hottest year on record.\n\nHausfather says a phaseout of sulphur in shipping fuels and water vapour released during the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai volcano in the South Pacific last year may also have played a role (sulphur masks underlying heating, water vapour increases it).\n\nBut underneath it all is a clear long-term warming trend that is driven by us. Human emissions are permanently adding the equivalent of an El Ni\u00f1o to the global system every five to 10 years.\n\nAnother study this week gives further insight into what this might mean. It suggests the climate system known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation could shut down faster than previously thought \u2013 by about 2050, and possibly as soon as this decade \u2013 if there are not deep cuts in emissions soon.\n\nSome scientists have responded cautiously to this piece of evidence and pointed out it is just one study. But most agreed with the overarching point - that the risk of an earlier ocean circulation breakdown has increased, with potentially disastrous and rapid ramifications for temperatures, rainfall and sea level rise. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation last collapsed 12,000 years ago.\n\nA logical response to all this would be to acknowledge we are in an unfolding emergency and act accordingly. The good news from scientists is that rapid action can still make a significant difference and limit future damage.\n\nIt would mean ruling a line under new fossil fuel developments when there are alternatives \u2013 that is, in virtually all cases \u2013 and taking a war-footing approach that prioritised accelerating the transition that every major scientific body and government agrees is necessary.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t mean pretending the gas industry - the largest source of global emissions growth last decade - is a climate solution. Or that nuclear energy is a serious proposition in Australia given the costs, timescales and social licence challenges. Or that carbon capture and storage is on track to be more than a niche technology. Or that paying for carbon offsets can justify fossil fuel use.\n\nIt would mean leaders acting as though they could persuade the public of what\u2019s required, rather than living in fear of how they might respond. Polls suggest a majority in many countries are open to action. Now\u2019s the chance.\n\nAlternatively, politicians could continue not delivering on the commitments made in Paris eight years ago and wait for another month as devastating as July 2023 before doing more.\n\nOne thing we can say with confidence: it is likely to come around soon enough.",

            "text": "As the torrent of rain slowed, then faded, the Vermont Green FC surged. The team had already turned a one-goal deficit into a 5-3 lead over AC Connecticut when, in the waning minutes of the match, Green forward Nacho Lerech slid the soccer ball into the back of the net.\n\nThe goal all but assured the Green a victory, which would improve their record to 7-2 in league play and send them to the top of the standings. The players rushed to the stands in celebration, and were met by 1,533 soggy diehards brandishing a frenzy of flags, drums and cheers. It was an archetypal sports scene, except for the 80-foot banner hanging to the left of the goal the Green had just scored on. In enormous white letters, it declared: Climate justice is social justice.\n\nThe sign was, by far, the most prominent in the stadium, rivaled only by an identical one behind the opposing net. And its message is one that the team contends is even more central to their identity than the wins they have been racking up.\n\n\u201cEverything revolves around our mission,\u201d said Patrick Infurna, one of the six people who co-founded the Burlington-based Vermont Green in 2020. The team plays in the USL2 (the semi-professional fourth division of the US soccer pyramid) and is in their second full season, which runs from mid-May through mid-July. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to implement big things and spark big things.\u201d\n\nThe Green certainly aren\u2019t the first sports team to address climate change. Most franchises now have some sort of sustainability program and the Seattle Kraken play hockey in Climate Pledge Arena. But the Green is the only squad in the United States with climate justice as its driving principle, putting it at the vanguard of a burgeoning movement to make sports a platform for climate action.\n\n\u201cYou see examples of environmental sustainability in all the leagues in the US,\u201d said Jonathan Casper, an associate professor of sports management at North Carolina State University who researches the intersection of sports and the natural environment. \u201cBut not to the extent that you see in Vermont \u2026 [It\u2019s] a core value of the club.\u201d\n\nThat was always the plan, said Infurna. The concept, he explained, was born in the early days of the pandemic lockdown and based loosely on the approach of the Forest Green Rovers, a team in England, which in 2018 became the first UN-certified carbon-neutral football club. But Infurna and his colleagues wanted to take that idea further by making climate justice a team\u2019s central mission. While the average age of the group hovered around 30, they hoped their combined skills would be enough to make that a reality. One person, for instance, had expertise in climate science, another two \u2013 including Infurna \u2013 already had professional experience in the soccer industry. And everyone, it turned out, had a connection to Vermont.\n\n\u201cThere was no better place to do this for us,\u201d said Infurna, of Burlington, a city that elected liberally-minded Bernie Sanders mayor four times and has set an ambitious goal to eliminate fossil fuel use in housing and ground transportation by 2030. That hunch quickly proved correct.\n\nThe Green\u2019s first season far surpassed its own expectations. After going 9-4-1 in league play, the squad made the playoffs and Major League Soccer teams drafted three of their players, including Owen O\u2019Malley, who was the Saint Louis SC\u2019s first-ever pick. That leap can be especially rewarding for USL2 athletes, who come largely from college and university ranks, and can\u2019t be paid because they would lose their NCAA eligibility.\n\nFans also came out in droves, and were soon pushing the 2,500-seat stadium that the Green rents from the University of Vermont to its capacity. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s only accelerated this year, when season tickets (which start at just $65) sold out along with nearly every home game.\n\nAlexander Levengood, a midfielder for the Vermont Green FC, signs an autograph for a fan after the team's match against AC Connecticut last week. Photograph: Patrick Guido\n\nAttending a Vermont Green match is in many ways a typical US sports experience. There\u2019s a boisterous announcer, an egg race at half-time, and of course a group of superfans: The Green Mountain Bhoys, as they\u2019ve dubbed themselves. In true superfan fashion, the Bhoys have their own section in the bleachers and are dripping in the team\u2019s range of green apparel \u2013 before the AC Connecticut match one member, Tyson Foster, rushed to snag the latest jersey design, bringing his collection to four.\n\nBut, unlike at other stadiums, the messages the team projects are overwhelmingly climate-centric. Throughout the evening, the PA system boomed with tips on how recycling can help fans reduce their carbon footprints and the benefits of riding a bike to the game. The ads ringing the pitch hawked a solar installer, a green energy investment firm, and a company selling kelp-based nutritional products, among others. Near the food stands there was a bin where fans could drop unwanted T-shirts that will be turned into new clothing \u2013 including the merchandise that the Green sells.\n\nThe team\u2019s social justice and community initiatives feature prominently as well. One of the signs along the pitch is for the Anti-Racist Soccer Club, a coalition the Green joined that fights racism in soccer. It also helps support \u2013 and plays friendly matches against \u2013 Juba Star FC, a local team comprised of Somali refugees. When not on the field, Green players often represent the organization around the city and state at events such as Juneteenth celebrations or as volunteers at a local community center for kids.\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that our mission is driving our business success,\u201d Infurna said. At least some players and fans agree.\n\nForward Denis Krioutchenkov came to the Green from Davidson College in North Carolina and could have joined a summer league closer to home. But Vermont offered more than just high-quality soccer. \u201cIf I play for a club that\u2019s against all these things that are wrong in the world right now,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve helped a lot.\u201d\n\nFans Delant\u00e9 Keys and his partner, Kyle, were similarly hooked by the soccer but stayed for the mission. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why we hold season tickets, versus coming only now and then,\u201d said Delant\u00e9, pausing to cheer as the Green scored its fourth goal against AC Connecticut. \u201cTheir values align with the state and what people are looking for, and we wanted to go out to support that.\u201d\n\nAfter getting people through the gate, Vermont Green strive to not only entertain, but educate. One way it does that is by giving each home game a theme, such as Renewable Energy Night or Sustainable Transportation Night. The team highlights the day\u2019s focus with PA announcements, signage and a half-time show where a team sponsor or community partner addresses the crowd.\n\nThe match against AC Connecticut was played on circularity night. The aim was to spotlight the importance of keeping products, and materials, in service as long as possible by designing systems that allow for easy reuse and regeneration. \u201cWe can actually take your shirt back and put it back into our supply chain to make more,\u201d Ben Prater told a slowly drying crowd at half-time. He is the sales manager for team sponsor Recover Brands, which makes merchandise for the Green \u2013 a partnership the company claims has saved around 33,000 pounds of carbon emissions and over 5m gallons of water.\n\nThe concept of circularity is relatively nascent even for those well-versed in climate lingo, but it\u2019s exactly the type of knowledge the team hopes to impart on fans. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to educate the public about anything that\u2019s related to environmental sustainability,\u201d Casper, the North Carolina State University professor, said, emphasizing that sports can be a nontraditional way of reaching people.\n\nErin Bucchin, 22, first learned about the Vermont Green at an Earth Day event and attended a handful of games last season. This year, she\u2019s a tailgating season ticket holder. She comes partly for the soccer and partly for the climate focus, which she says has impacted her own sustainability practices. \u201cI learned which plastics are recyclable,\u201d she explained. \u201cNo black plastics.\u201d\n\nSustainability initiatives have proliferated across the industry in recent years, said Roger McClendon, executive director of the Green Sports Alliance, an environmentally focused trade organization. And while he warns that fans, and sponsors, should be on the lookout for inauthentic or half-hearted attempts to capitalize on the sustainability movement, intentional \u201cgreenwashing\u201d is relatively rare. \u201cSports have the power to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some major momentum.\u201d\n\nVermont Green FC midfielder Federico Tellez turns on an AC Connecticut player during Saturday\u2019s game. Photograph: Patrick Guido\n\nInfurna says the Vermont Green have faced very little criticism. The only real complaint he noted was about the decision to keep players off the field until the national anthem is finished; a suggestion the Anti-Racist Soccer Club made to avoid putting players in an awkward position. The positive attention, on the other hand, has been overwhelming.\n\nThe Green have been written about by the BBC, told their story on the popular soccer podcast Men in Blazers, and fielded numerous inquiries from other sports teams looking to learn more about their work. The intrigue means more work for Infurna and his cofounders, who have yet to take a salary from the Green and all hold other jobs (Infurna has recently been working for the Eintracht Frankfurt soccer team in the German Bundesliga). But, he says, that\u2019s a good problem to have: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this concept proves you can do it anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe interest in Vermont Green doesn\u2019t surprise Jessica Murfree, a visiting assistant professor at Texas A&M University who researches the effects of climate change on sport. \u201cI would expect that we start to see more of the strategy that Vermont Green has spearheaded,\u201d she said. She adds that consumers, fans, and sponsors are increasingly using their purchasing power to support such an approach. \u201cThey are demanding more these days than just statements.\u201d\n\nIndividual athletes have also been increasingly common catalysts for climate action \u2013 especially those competing in sports where the threat of a warming world is most immediately glaring. Cross-country skier Jessie Diggins remembers a 2016 trip to Finland, where the US ski team had always gone for virtually guaranteed early-season training. But the snow was melting, the moss was growing and the skiing was abysmal.\n\n\u201cSeeing puddles in the arctic circle was the last straw,\u201d she said of her decision to become more active in efforts to combat climate change. \u201dWhat if I lean into my platform and use sport to make more of an impact?\u201d\n\nDiggins has since collaborated with the nonprofit Protect Our Winters to use her three Olympic medals (including a historic gold) as a gateway for advocating climate action. She\u2019s met with everyone from her home-state Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to the Conservative Climate Caucus. \u201cMost people get excited by Olympic gold medals,\u201d she explains, \u201cand we use that.\u201d\n\nUnlike for Diggins, climate change has remained a relatively distant threat to the Vermont Green. There\u2019s no snow needed for a soccer match and news outlets commonly list Burlington as one of the best places to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The day after the victory over AC Connecticut, however, wildfire smoke from Quebec rolled across the border and blanketed northern Vermont.\n\n\u201cRarely are we really hit by the first-hand severity of it,\u201d said Infurna. But as the Air Quality Index climbed above 200, a level the Environmental Protection Agency calls \u201cvery unhealthy,\u201d the Vermont Green coaches had to make its Monday practice shorter and less intense.\n\n\u201cIt was a holy shit moment,\u201d said Infurna, contrasting a future in which climate change is certain to exacerbate events such as wildfires with the team\u2019s generally upbeat approach to climate action. \u201cWe can be optimistic, but we have to be urgent.\u201d",

            "text": "Zac Goldsmith has resigned as a minister, accusing Rishi Sunak of being \u201cuninterested\u201d in the environment \u2013 but No 10 claimed he quit after being told to apologise for undermining the parliamentary inquiry into Boris Johnson.\n\nThe Conservative peer and former MP published a long resignation letter detailing his disappointment with the prime minister for causing \u201cparalysis\u201d on the environment within Whitehall and choosing to attend the party of a media baron rather than an international environmental forum.\n\nHowever, Sunak hit back with a letter saying Goldsmith had been asked to say sorry for a tweet that appeared to challenge the privileges committee inquiry into whether Johnson misled parliament.\n\nThe prime minister said Goldsmith\u2019s comments were \u201cincompatible\u201d with his job in government and he had been asked to apologise but \u201cdecided a different course\u201d.\n\nIn response, Goldsmith said he had been happy to acknowledge he should not have commented on the privileges committee and denied this was the cause of his resignation.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur parliamentary democracy can only be strengthened by robust exchange and self-criticism and parliamentarians should absolutely be free to be critical of its reports and proceedings.\n\n\u201cBut as a minister it is true to say that I shouldn\u2019t have commented publicly. No 10 asked me to acknowledge that and I was and am happy to do so.\n\n\u201cMy decision to step down has been a long time coming. When I compare what I and my amazing team were able to do before the current PM took office with the slow progress today, it seems to me I can no longer justify being in government.\u201d\n\nGoldsmith\u2019s accusations are likely to be unhelpful to Sunak in the lead-up to an election, with opposition parties expected to emphasise the government\u2019s failure to do enough on the climate emergency, animal welfare and sewage discharges.\n\nEd Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, called Goldsmith\u2019s departure a \u201cdevastating indictment of Rishi Sunak and his whole government on climate and nature\u201d.\n\nIt has been a privilege to have been able to make a difference to a cause I have been committed to for as long as I remember. But this govt\u2019s apathy in the face of the greatest challenge we face makes continuing in my role untenable. Reluctantly I am therefore stepping down pic.twitter.com/KDJKN3i6ER \u2014 Zac Goldsmith (@ZacGoldsmith) June 30, 2023\n\nOn Thursday the privileges committee named Goldsmith as one of the politicians who had undermined its work on whether Johnson misled parliament. The Liberal Democrats called on Sunak to sack Goldsmith because of the committee\u2019s findings that eight politicians had put \u201cimproper pressure\u201d on its inquiry.\n\nThe committee highlighted that Goldsmith had retweeted a tweet calling the inquiry a witch-hunt and kangaroo court and added: \u201cExactly this. There was only ever going to be one outcome and the evidence was totally irrelevant to it.\u201d\n\nIn his letter stepping down from the Foreign Office, where his portfolio was overseas territories, Commonwealth, environment, energy and climate, Goldsmith said it had been a privilege to work as an environment minister, particularly under Johnson.\n\nHe said he had been horrified by the Sunak government\u2019s \u201cabandonment\u201d of policies around animal welfare, and that its efforts on environmental issues at home had \u201csimply ground to a standstill\u201d.\n\nAddressing Sunak directly, the Tory peer said: \u201cPrime minister, having been able to get so much done previously, I have struggled even to hold the line in recent months. The problem is not that the government is hostile to the environment, it is that you, our prime minister, are simply uninterested. That signal, or lack of it, has trickled down through Whitehall and caused a kind of paralysis.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

He wrote: \u201cToo often we are simply absent from key international fora. Only last week you seemingly chose to attend the party of a media baron rather than attend a critically important environment summit in Paris that ordinarily the UK would have co-led.\u201d\n\nIt is understood Goldsmith had been feeling uneasy about Sunak\u2019s commitment to the environment since the beginning of his premiership, when the prime minister had to be cajoled into attending Cop27.\n\nThe Conservative peer told friends at the time that he was considering resigning from a government that had seemingly deprioritised the environment and the natural world, a view that was cemented by a tussle over nature-based payments for farmers.\n\nHowever, he planned to stay in post for as long as it took to get the international forest agreement, agreed at Cop26, over the line. The deal between more than 100 leaders to save the world\u2019s forests, partly made possible with funding from the UK, was seen as one of the great successes of the climate summit.\n\nThis month the peer made up his mind to resign when Sunak\u2019s government scrapped the kept animals bill after pressure from the hunting lobby, which was concerned that hunting hounds would be affected by its measures. The legislation would have cracked down on puppy farming as well as banning keeping primates as pets and banning live exports of farm animals. Friends say Goldsmith was \u201csickened\u201d by the decision and wrote to Sunak begging him to reconsider, but that letter was ignored.\n\nAfter learning that international development funding to protect forests would not be honoured by Sunak, allies of Goldsmith say he made the final decision to quit.\n\nGoldsmith, a longtime ally of Johnson and his wife, Carrie, has resigned from a post before for environmental reasons, when he triggered a byelection over the issue of Heathrow expansion in his then seat of Richmond.",

            "text": "In the ballroom of the five star Savoy hotel on the Strand in central London, the super-rich and their advisers were this week advised that they may soon need to watch out for people with \u201cpitchforks and torches\u201d unless they do more to use their fortunes to help the millions struggling with the cost of living crisis.\n\nAt an investment conference organised by Spear\u2019s wealth management magazine, members of the global elite and their financial teams were told by progressive advisers that there was a \u201creal risk of actual insurrection\u201d and \u201ccivil disruption\u201d if the yawning inequality gap between rich and poor was allowed to widen as a result of energy and food price hikes hitting squeezed households.\n\nJulia Davies, a founding member of Patriotic Millionaires UK, a group of super-rich people calling for the introduction of a wealth tax, warned that global poverty and the climate emergency were going to get \u201cso much worse\u201d unless the wealthy did more to help poorer citizens.\n\nJulia Davies, left, said global poverty and the climate crisis were going to get \u2018so much worse\u2019 unless the wealthy did more to help the poor. Photograph: Aidan Synnott\n\n\u201cEveryone can say it is somebody else\u2019s responsibility,\u201d Davies said. \u201cBut it is the wealthiest in society who are the people who can actually really do something about it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it is the wealthiest in society who are right now advocating to slow down the pace of tackling these huge issues. Maybe they think that they are going to be OK. I don\u2019t honestly believe they are, and I definitely don\u2019t think their kids and their grandkids are going to be OK.\u201d\n\nShe told the audience of about 500 members of the global super-rich and their advisers they had the opportunity to be \u201cthe heroes\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou guys could be part of the turning point that protects your children, your grandchildren and your client\u2019s children and grandchildren. Isn\u2019t that worth something?\u201d\n\nAlexandra Loydon, the director of partner engagement at the wealth management firm St James\u2019s Place, asked the audience to look around the Savoy\u2019s 113-year-old Lancaster Ballroom and \u201cat the level of wealth collectively in this room\u201d.\n\n\u201c[The wealth] that we manage, and the impact that we could have, that is absolutely enormous. And, I do genuinely believe that we all have a role to play and not just in facilitating what the next generation of clients want, but educating the current generation of clients as well.\u201d\n\nClare Woodcraft said wealthy people\u2019s philanthropic efforts often had a \u2018bad reputation\u2019. Photograph: Aidan Synnott\n\nClare Woodcraft, a fellow at the Centre for Strategic Philanthropy at the University of Cambridge, said wealthy people\u2019s philanthropic efforts had a \u201cbad reputation\u201d because the industry was \u201cpoorly understood, poorly executed and poorly regulated\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is often, unfortunately, too much focus on the passion behind philanthropy and the feelgood factor and not the actual need,\u201d said Woodcraft, who works as an adviser to the super-rich. \u201cPhilanthropists are all too keen to jump in when they surmise that there might be a need, without actually having the data.\u201d\n\nClare Woodcraft, second from the right, is a fellow at the Centre for Strategic Philanthropy at the University of Cambridge. Photograph: Aidan Synnott\n\nShe said many rich people wanted to set up their own educational or health foundations without checking whether there was a need or an existing charity or government-funded programme working to address the issue.\n\n\u201cI still see way too often family offices that come to me and say: \u2018We want to do education, we want to set up a foundation and we want to do it in market X\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nWoodcraft said in these cases she would ask the family for their rationale, only for them to reply: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s just get some quick wins, let\u2019s get the money out there.\n\n\u201cThat is the challenge. We need to step back, and have a clear methodology for investing philanthropic capital, because that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to maximise impact and hence mitigate some of the risks of reputational damage.\u201d",

            "text": "Frances Ryan is right to raise the question of just what we can expect from an incoming Labour government (By telling us so little about its policy plans, Labour tells us all we need to know, 13 July). The country clearly needs a radical break from the collective failed policies of five consecutive Tory prime ministers.\n\nWhen Keir Starmer made 10 pledges during the Labour party leadership campaign in 2020, he said there would be \u201cno stepping back from our core principles\u201d and that he would increase income tax for the top 5% of earners, keep public services in public hands, and support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water.\n\nI think Starmer believes in these principles, but has listened too closely to key strategists who do not. It is not so much that Labour is rowing back from these reforms, but that the strategists have taken the boat out of the water, and the shadow leadership along with it.\n\nTo obtain the reforms required to heal this unequal country, we need at least 10 years of a Labour government. If the model is Tory-lite policies, it is difficult to see how the electorate would not vote back in the real thing through sheer disappointment after five years. Starmer had the right pledges in 2020; now he needs to be bold.\n\nGary Nethercott\n\nWoodbridge, Suffolk\n\nI commend Frances Ryan\u2019s article about the Labour party\u2019s lack of policy under the leadership of Keir Starmer. When Rishi Sunak dumped the pledge to give \u00a311.6bn to countries tackling global heating, Labour could say nothing as it had already \u201cpostponed\u201d its pledge of \u00a328bn a year to help Britain combat the climate crisis.

Pakistan is one of the countries that has been named as a \u2018hunger hotspot\u2019 by the UN. Photograph: Nadeem Khawar/EPA\n\nThe 2023 edition of the annual State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report shows a world gripped by a widespread and urgent food crisis.\n\nIn 2022, an estimated 900 million people \u2013 or 11.3% of the global population \u2013 were suffering from severe food insecurity, defined as when a person has run out of food or has gone an entire day without eating during the year.\n\nNearly one in three people \u2013 2.4 billion, or 29.6% of the world\u2019s population\u2013 did not have constant access to food, the report found.\n\nMillions of children continue to be malnourished: in 2022, 45 million children under five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, and 148 million children of the same age had stunted growth and development.\n\nMaximo Torero, chief economist at the FAO and the main author of the report, warned that although the climate crisis had not affected hunger levels in 2022 as much as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, it would have \u201ca severe impact over time\u201d.\n\nTorero said the global food system was plagued by \u201csignificant risks and uncertainties\u201d and was \u201cvery vulnerable\u201d. Very few countries in the world exported cereals, for example, and if anything were to happen to them in terms of a climate shock, food prices would rise, he said.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a constant problem, a constant vulnerability of the system, because of how concentrated exporting production countries are,\u201d he said.\n\nPauline Chetcuti, policy lead at Oxfam, said: \u201cIt is unforgivable for governments to watch billions of people going hungry in a world of plenty. While food and energy companies more than doubled their profits last year, nearly a third of the world\u2019s population were moderately or severely food insecure.\u201d\n\nCountries in west Africa are seeing a dangerous rise in people without enough food due to the effects of the climate crisis as well as regional conflict, and food prices skyrocketing following Covid and the war in Ukraine, according to the British Red Cross.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the number of people facing severe food shortages has doubled in the last two years alone,\u201d said Alex Wade, senior disaster-management coordinator at the British Red Cross.\n\n\u201cAn important driver of this has been climate change, which made the devastating floods last year far more likely, destroying crops and further driving up food prices.\u201d",

MPs and others have been highly critical and an external review of the Bank\u2019s forecasting approach has been commissioned.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just economists in the forecasting business. Indeed, new research takes the \u201crubbish forecasts\u201d heat off them by focusing instead on rather more famous forecasters: meteorologists. Predictions of sun or rain, rather than GDP or inflation, are understandably much more important parts of our daily lives.\n\nThe headline finding is that inaccurate weather forecasts cost lives (or more positively, better forecasts would reduce mortality rates). Why? Because extreme heat or cold raises mortality levels, and we manage that by changing our behaviour when we see it coming. We all know weather forecasts make us change our plans (during a heatwave, you don\u2019t book a hike) or what we wear, and this research also shows weather forecasts affect how we use our time and energy.\n\nThe authors show that forecast errors are particularly a problem when it\u2019s very hot: extreme heat is even more deadly when we are not expecting it. To provide a sense of what\u2019s at stake, they show that reducing forecast errors by 50% would save 2,200 lives a year in the US. And they estimate the public would be happy to pay $2bn (\u00a31.56bn) a year for that benefit, which rises to $3bn given the growth in extreme weather induced by climate change.\n\nSo better forecasts are well worth aiming for.

            "publish_date": "2023-07-05T00:00:00",
            "text": "Driving an electric car on a single charge from London to Milan sounds like an impossible dream. Yet Japanese carmaker Toyota claims that by 2027 motorists will be able to buy such a vehicle. Running the air conditioner at full blast might reduce such an impressive range, but Toyota says drivers will be able to recharge in 10 minutes before they are back on the road. If this all sounds too good to be true, that\u2019s because it probably is.\n\nWhat Toyota says it has found is nothing less than the holy grail of battery technology \u2013 the so-called solid state solution \u2013 which has long eluded the industry. Instead of a liquid core, the new battery has a solid one between electrodes. This means it is smaller and can store more energy \u2013 delivering a bigger range for the same weight. The heavy flammable liquid cores can also overheat and explode. Since 2017, UK emergency services have attended hundreds of electric vehicle fires.\n\nRapid technological advances have historically been the norm in capitalism. Rich-world governments have rightly come to see electric cars as an essential way to reduce air pollution and crack down on climate-warming emissions, while satisfying an individual\u2019s desire for personal transportation. Compared with combustion-engine cars, they have significant environmental benefits. But the climate crisis should be a chance to question whether the motorcar itself has become too embedded in our everyday lives. The future of \u201cmobility\u201d must involve much more than private cars.\n\nIt would be churlish not to recognise that the Japanese carmaker\u2019s announcement is a form of progress. There should be a sensible place for cars as part of an integrated transport plan in the years to come. As Toyota has been a sceptical voice about electric vehicles, a change of heart, if sincere, is to be welcomed. The company had previously staked its future on its range of hybrid-engine cars, powered by both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, arguing that shortages of key battery materials and insufficient charging infrastructure would prevent a universal switch to electric vehicles in the short term. Whether Toyota will be able to leapfrog its rivals remains to be seen, however, as mass production requires a far more stringent level of quality control and reliability.\n\nBut even a low-carbon-emitting car remains a low-capacity mode of transportation. Doubling down on its near-monopoly over the surface transportation system would lead to a future of ever-worsening congestion and road accidents, which currently cost 30 lives in the UK every week. Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, allegedly tried to kill the California high-speed rail project in 2013. A decade later the electric bullet train has announced it will be solar-powered. Industry lobbying in the 1930s helped pave the way for a US lifestyle dependent on cars and oil. That must not be replicated for electric vehicles today.\n\nThe global north cannot just bet on a Toyota- or Tesla-style decarbonisation. The volume of critical minerals needed for decarbonising the rich world on its current growth path would leave nothing for poorer nations. Sunsetting undesirable technologies and infrastructures (such as carbon-intensive motoring) must be accompanied by a recognition that we all have to live within the world\u2019s material constraints. In the richer world that must mean prioritising mass transportation and rethinking urban planning, not vesting so much hope in our current pattern of living continuing unchanged.",

            "text": "Recent advances such as Open AI\u2019s GPT-4 chatbot have awakened the world to how sophisticated artificial intelligence has become and how rapidly the field is advancing. Could this powerful new technology help save the world? We asked five leading AI researchers to lay out their best-case scenarios.\n\n1 \u2018More intelligence will lead to better everything\u2019\n\nIn 1999, I predicted that computers would pass the Turing test [and be indistinguishable from human beings] by 2029. Stanford university found that alarming, and organised an international conference \u2013 experts came from all over the world. They mostly agreed that it would happen, but not in 30 years \u2013 in 100 years. This poll has been taken every year since 1999. My guess has remained 2029, and the consensus view of AI experts is now also 2029.\n\n\u2018Everything\u2019s going to improve\u2019 \u2026 a laboratory technician conducts AI-based cervical cancer screening in Wuhan, China. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nEverything\u2019s going to improve. We will be able to cure cancer and heart disease, and so on, using simulated biology \u2013 and extend our lives. The average life expectancy was 30 in 1800; it was 48 in 1900; it\u2019s now pushing 80. I predict that we\u2019ll reach \u201clongevity escape velocity\u201d by 2029. Now, as you go forward a year, you\u2019re using up a year of your longevity, but you\u2019re actually getting back about three or four months from scientific progress. So, actually, you haven\u2019t lost a year; you\u2019ve lost eight or nine months. By 2029, you\u2019ll get back that entire year from scientific progress. As we go past 2029, you\u2019ll actually get back more than a year.\n\nMost movies about AI have an \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality, but that\u2019s really not the case. This is not an alien invasion of intelligent machines; it\u2019s the result of our own efforts to make our infrastructure and our way of life more intelligent. It\u2019s part of human endeavour. We merge with our machines. Ultimately, they will extend who we are. Our mobile phone, for example, makes us more intelligent and able to communicate with each other. It\u2019s really part of us already. It might not be literally connected to you, but nobody leaves home without one. It\u2019s like half your brain.\n\nIf the wrong people take control of AI, that could be bad for the rest of us, so we really need to keep pace with that, which we are doing. But we already have things that have nothing to do with AI, such as atomic weapons, that could destroy everyone. So it\u2019s not really making life more dangerous. And, it can actually give us some tools to prevent people from harming us.\n\nThe rate of change will be difficult for some people. The railways changed the US, but it took decades; this is changing it in months. If we were in 1900 and I went through all the different ways people made money, and I said: \u2018All of these will be obsolete in 100 years,\u2019 people would go: \u2018Oh, my God! There\u2019s gonna be no jobs.\u2019 But in fact, we have more jobs today \u2013 in areas that were really only invented in the last few decades. That will continue.\n\nWe\u2019ve made great progress but there are still people who are desperate. More intelligence will lead to better everything. We will have the possibility of everybody having a very good life.\n\nRay Kurzweil, computer scientist, inventor, author and futurist\n\n2\n\nEveryone wants a silver bullet to solve climate change; unfortunately there isn\u2019t one. But there are lots of ways AI can help fight climate change. While there is no single big thing that AI will do, there are many medium-sized things.\n\nA spectroradiometer image of the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil \u2026 AI can pick out where deforestation is taking place. Photograph: Stocktrek Images/Getty Images\n\nThe first role AI can play in climate action is distilling raw data into useful information \u2013 taking big datasets, which would take too much time for a human to process, and pulling information out in real time to guide policy or private-sector action. For example, taking satellite imagery and picking out where deforestation is happening, how biodiversity is changing, where coastal communities are at risk from flooding. These kinds of tools are already starting to be used by organisations around the world, from the UN to insurance companies, and we\u2019re working to scale them up and improve them.\n\nThe second role is optimisation of complicated systems \u2013 such as the heating and cooling system in a building, where there are many controls that an algorithm can operate efficiently. Smart thermostats have become mainstream in our homes, and now we\u2019re starting to see that for skyscrapers and factories. Many companies are improving energy efficiency, and there is a lot of progress still to be made, especially in industries such as steel and cement, which are often resistant to adopting new technologies.\n\nThe next theme is forecasting. AI can\u2019t predict something big-picture like what\u2019s going to happen to the economy \u2013 but forecasts make sense for narrow problems with lots of data, such as what the power demand is going to be at a particular time, or what power is going to be available based on the sun and the wind, forecasting how a storm is going to move, or the productivity of crops based upon the weather.\n\nThinking of AI as a futuristic tool that will lead to immeasurable good or harm is a distraction from the ways we are using it now\n\nThe fourth theme is in speeding up scientific simulations, such as in climate and weather modelling. We have really good climate models, but sometimes they can take months to run, even on supercomputers, and that is an obstacle. We understand climate change very well but that doesn\u2019t mean we know exactly what is going to happen at each point. So, having faster climate models can aid local and regional responses.\n\nAI in climate action isn\u2019t about what computers can do in the far future \u2013 we can\u2019t trust some speculative future technology to rescue us. Climate change is already killing people, and many more people are going to die even in a best-case scenario, but we get to decide now just how bad it gets. Action taken decades from now is much less valuable than action taken soon. Thinking of AI as a futuristic tool that will lead to immeasurable good or harm is a distraction from the ways we can and are using AI tools right now, and what we can do to align them with what\u2019s best for society.\n\nDavid Rolnick, assistant professor and Canada CIFAR AI Chair, McGill University School of Computer Science, Montreal\n\nAn attendee controls an AI-powered prosthetic hand during 2021 World Artificial Intelligence conference in Shanghai. Photograph: VCG/Visual China Group/Getty Images\n\n3 \u2018There is going to be an amazing revolution in healthcare\u2019\n\nThere is a rapid transformation in the pharmaceutical industry and university research, where they\u2019re shifting to the use of AI to help discover new molecules and new drugs that would have fewer side-effects, and that would help us cure diseases that currently we don\u2019t know how to cure, including cancer, potentially.\n\nOne reason AI can be useful here is that the body is very complicated. Even a single cell is extremely complicated: you have 20,000 genes, and they all interact with each other. Biotechnology has progressed to the point where we can measure all the genes\u2019 activity in a single cell at once. While we collect huge quantities of data, the quantity of data is so large that humans are unable to read it. But because machines can, they are able to build models of how your cells work, and how they could be changing under different circumstances that cause disease. So, you can see what happens if you make an intervention; if you introduce a pollutant or a drug, what will be the effect?\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Canadian Press/Shutterstock\n\nThere are many academics working in these areas right now. One of the research programmes in my group is about using AI for discovering drugs for infectious diseases, which don\u2019t get a lot of attention from pharma \u2013 because they\u2019re not profitable, they\u2019re happening in developing countries, or they\u2019re very rare, such as pandemics. There is also the issue of antimicrobial resistance \u2013 where mutations of microbes mean that our current drugs are no longer effective. This is like a catastrophe dangling in front of our noses, it could come at any time.\n\nThis is not just something happening in academia. There are now dozens of startups that have been created at the intersection of AI and drug discovery, broadly speaking. These have been injected with billions of dollars, while pharmaceutical companies are beefing up their machine-learning departments.\n\nHaving better models could be a real gamechanger. The big cost of drug discovery is that you have to try a lot of things that don\u2019t work. Trying one drug isn\u2019t that expensive, but usually there\u2019s something that goes wrong. Currently, it costs a billion dollars to develop a new drug; it could easily be 10 times less with these advances. It is probably going to take years before people see an effect, but I am pretty sure it\u2019s going to be an amazing revolution in terms of healthcare.\n\nYoshua Bengio, professor of computer science, the University of Montreal; scientific director, Mila \u2013 Quebec AI Institute\n\n4 \u2018AI could radically accelerate the process of technological progress itself\u2019\n\nIf we figured out how people are going to share in the wealth that AI unlocks, then I think we could end up in a world where people don\u2019t have to work to eat, and are instead taking on projects because they are meaningful to them. I often use the analogy of children. They do a lot of things because they enjoy them, and not just because they\u2019re the best person in the world at them. They paint and draw, and they have a lot of fun; I paint and draw, and I have a lot of fun, even though [AI image generator] Midjourney is way better at making pictures than me. Similarly, since the 90s, we have had computer programs that can beat humans at chess, but lots of people still play chess.\n\nIf you have intelligent AI systems that are accessible to people, it\u2019s as if everybody has access to an infinitely patient teacher so you could imagine training these AI systems to be an interface between humans and other humans.\n\n\u2018In a couple of decades, humanity could get to the kind of advanced future that feels like it\u2019s hundreds or thousands of years away\u2019 \u2026 Ajeya Cotra. Photograph: Donald Iain Smith/Getty Images\n\nI think there are things that we might choose to not have AI replace. Those will probably have to do with governance of our society and our processes of trying to figure out what are good things to do with the world. How do we manage our resources? What are the laws we\u2019re going to put in place? What is the way to treat people fairly?\n\nAnd, if you imagine, for example, the possibility of expansion into space with technology invented by AI systems, we would have choices: should we do that? And what would we do with the resources that we unlock if we do expand into space? AI systems could help us think that through, but it might be that we want those decisions to be made by people.\n\nWhen you zoom out and look at where humanity has come from, on the scale of centuries and millennia, freedom and health and equality have been getting better over time, and better technology has played a huge part in that. Truly advanced AI systems could continue that story \u2013 they could be more than just another technology; they could automate and radically accelerate the process of technological progress itself. In just a couple of decades, humanity could get to the kind of advanced future that feels like it\u2019s hundreds or thousands of years away. This is not at all guaranteed, but I think it\u2019s within reach if we get this right.\n\nAjeya Cotra, senior research analyst on AI alignment, Open Philanthropy; editor, Planned Obsolescence\n\n5 \u2018We can flourish, not just for the next election cycle, but for billions of years\u2019\n\n\u2018The sky\u2019s the limit\u2019 \u2026 MIT physicist Max Tegmark. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe positive, optimistic scenario is that we responsibly develop superintelligence in a way that allows us to control it and benefit from it. The \u201ccontrol\u201d part is, I think, more hopeful than many people assume. There is a field of computer science called formal verification, where you come up with a rigorous mathematical proof that a program is always going to do what it\u2019s supposed to. You can even create what is called \u201cproof-carrying code\u201d; it works in the opposite way to a virus checker. If a virus checker can prove that the code you are going to run is malicious, it won\u2019t run it; with proof-carrying code, only if the code can prove that it\u2019s going to do what you want it to do will your hardware run it. This is the type of mechanism we need to ensure advanced AI is safe.\n\nIt could be the greatest empowerment moment in human history\n\nWe can\u2019t do this yet with GPT-4 or other powerful AI systems, because those systems are not written in a human programming language; they are a giant artificial neural network, and we have almost no clue how they work. But there is a very active research field called mechanistic interpretability. The goal is to take these black-box neural networks and figure out how they work. If this field makes so much progress that we can use AI itself to extract out the knowledge from other AI and see what it has learned, we could then reimplement it in some other kind of computational architecture \u2013 some sort of proof-carrying code \u2013 that you can trust. Then you can still use the power of neural networks to discover and learn, but now you can trust something that\u2019s way smarter than you. Then what are we going to do with it? Well, the sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nWe can cure all diseases, stabilise our climate, eliminate poverty, etc. We can flourish not just for the next election cycle, but for billions of years. We have been on this planet for more than 100,000 years, and most of the time we have been like a leaf blowing around in the wind, without much control of our destiny, just trying to not starve or get eaten. Science and technology and human intelligence have made us the captains of our own ship. I find that inspiring. If we can build and control superintelligence, we can quickly go from being limited by our own stupidity to being limited by the laws of physics. It could be the greatest empowerment moment in human history.\n\nMax Tegmark, a professor of physics and AI researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology",

            "text": "Is the cry for civility in politics an attempt to soothe a polarised nation or to shield the powerful from scrutiny? We still do not know who threw orange confetti at George Osborne and his wife, Thea Rogers, on their wedding day. While former home secretary Priti Patel was among those quick to denounce Just Stop Oil \u2013 as \u201cshameful, attention seeking, disrespectful low life\u201d \u2013 the climate activists clarified that they weren\u2019t responsible, despite applauding the apparent stunt.\n\nWhen I was asked about this incident on television by wedding guest Ed Balls - Labour\u2019s former shadow chancellor, who is to co-host a podcast with Osborne \u2013 reprimanded me for failing to appreciate that \u201cit\u2019s possible, Owen, to be civil to people and disagree with them\u201d. Elsewhere, a former aide to Margaret Thatcher decried \u201cthe hate-filled left\u201d, while Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves denounced the stunt as \u201ccounterproductive and rude\u201d.\n\nThe action didn\u2019t physically harm anyone and was apparently meant to draw attention to the legacy of Osborne\u2019s time in office. The former chancellor has, after all, never been held to account for his record on the climate. He slashed financial support for energy efficiency for struggling households, which increased fuel bills for poor people as well as undermining climate goals; and he opposed Britain becoming a world leader in fighting the climate emergency. Equally, he has never faced financial or social consequences for the brutal austerity that caused deaths, ruined lives and left the country hollowed out by privatisation.\n\n00:00:30 Protester throws orange confetti over George Osborne at his wedding \u2013 video\n\nYet there is outrage that Osborne\u2019s special day was disrupted \u2013 and there are demands for more \u201ccivility\u201d in the way we conduct our political discourse. An obvious point is that a disrupted wedding is by no means as devastating as the impact of Osborne-ism. A more thoughtful case is that our political and media system fails to hold the powerful to account for their lasting impact on our society. That means we do not learn any lessons, allowing evils to repeat themselves. This failure leaves a vacuum, which is readily filled by activists who will seek any tactic that is peaceful but attention-grabbing to create the sort of accountability that is lacking in our system. After all, Osborne has been allowed to reinvent himself as a respectable and sage political pundit, whose wedding is attended by Labour opponents and prominent journalists, and whose record receives little meaningful scrutiny.\n\nIn a healthier democracy, we would take seriously an academic study which suggested that more than 330,000 excess deaths in Britain were linked to austerity. We would have properly debated evidence that Osborne\u2019s imposition of a two-child benefit limit did nothing to force parents to find work, but left hundreds of thousands of families in poverty. There would have been accountability over how a bereaved parent whose beloved child died, meaning they had a \u201cspare bedroom\u201d, was compelled to pay Osborne\u2019s bedroom tax. None of this happened, and so our politicians know they can impose further suffering on poor people for political gain with no meaningful consequences.\n\nCivility politics inevitably reflects who has power and who does not. Osborne\u2019s onslaught on the welfare state was accompanied by rhetoric deliberately stigmatising benefit claimants. Charities claimed there was a surge in abuse directed at disabled people. This abuse has been largely missing from discussions about civility in politics, because those responsible are powerful and those on the receiving end tend to be voiceless. We have seen the same phenomenon with migrants, refugees, Muslims and trans people. The powerful can position themselves as victims of the passions of the mob, while using their platforms to victimise vulnerable minorities with no repercussions.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely understandable to desire a political conversation free of needlessly inflammatory rhetoric and disruptive protest, but a political system that is unable to hold the powerful to account will inevitably breed a desire to seek justice in imaginative ways. It shouldn\u2019t take orange confetti to draw attention to the brutal consequences of an all too recent past.",

The potential for discovery in the deep \u2013 of new life forms, of clues to how life on Earth began, of organisms that could be used for new medicines \u2013 is incalculable.\n\nIt\u2019s a cruel irony that renewable energy, at least at this point of technological development, is thought to require nonrenewable deep-sea minerals, pulled from ecosystems we know so little about. But we can\u2019t protect our planet by destroying it, nor can we mine our way out of the climate crisis.\n\nLast week, a little-known autonomous global body, the International Seabed Authority council, opted to delay the start of large-scale commercial ocean mining likely until 2025 amid growing opposition from world leaders, ocean advocates and marine scientists worldwide.\n\nThis moment marks a profound and rare opportunity when it comes to environmental protection. Rather than learning the gravest impacts of resource extraction years or decades into the process, we now have the opportunity to look before we leap.\n\nDuring this pause we need to pursue three goals for human and planetary health: scientific exploration and research; continued pressure on land-based mining companies to clean up their act; and innovation to answer our connectivity, mobility and energy needs in more sustainable ways.\n\nDeep-sea mining might seem, initially, like a distant concern. But consider the process: mining companies send mammoth robotic vehicles, outfitted with spiked wheels and powerful suction tubes, thousands of meters underwater. Once minerals are extracted, the machinery dumps wastewater, sediment and all the other disruptive outputs of the mining process back into the water, damaging seafloor habitats and the life within them. From seafloor and ship-based discharges, plumes spread and pollute the water column even further afield, suffocating and imperiling ocean life.\n\nThis is the equivalent of vacuuming your rug, rescuing a lost earring from the canister, and then dumping all the collected debris back on to the rug and into the air in the room \u2013 except, in this case, you can only guess at how badly the debris will damage your rug, your home or your family.\n\nThere has to be a better way \u2013 for the safety of our ocean, our planet and ourselves. It starts with research, from basic science to understanding the full scale of potential mining impacts. We have so much yet to discover on the seafloor: new species, compounds that can treat disease or even cure the next pandemic, and insight into how life began and how it might regenerate.\n\nThe ecosystems at the bottom of the ocean have developed over the same time periods as the minerals within them \u2013 up to millions of years \u2013 and damage to them may be irreversible. The same is true for all the marine life that might suffer, right up to the fisheries that contribute $1.5tn annually to the global economy and provide protein for 3 billion people.\n\nBefore even considering digging up the ocean, we should continue to pressure the mining industry to clean up its act on land\n\nWe already know the damage mining can cause on land, and yet we\u2019re still mining. Before even considering digging up the ocean, we should continue to pressure the mining industry to clean up its act on land.\n\nPerhaps the most challenging step we must take is to reduce demand. Renewable energy manufacturers and innovators should design their products with responsibly sourced minerals and with an eye to reclaiming minerals and collecting batteries for reuse. Leaving aside the opportunity for innovation, with existing methods, recycling dead batteries alone could reduce global demand for electric car minerals \u2013 by 55% for newly mined copper, 25% for lithium and 35% for cobalt and nickel by 2040.\n\nWe have to think outside the sedan. Simply replacing gas-powered cars with electric vehicles on a one-to-one basis could mean an impossible demand for minerals. Electrifying mass transit, telecommuting and other solutions can ease the global burden \u2013 particularly if industry, governments and all of us consider this an opportunity to creatively and completely reimagine transportation and decarbonization more broadly.\n\nThe stakes aren\u2019t just high \u2013 they\u2019re existential, for the ocean and for all life on Earth. We need to move quickly toward a renewable energy future, but let\u2019s not mortgage the ocean to pay for it.",

            "text": "Nigel Farage imagines he is a true Brit, the man who said what the establishment prohibited and so allowed Britain to shed noxious European influence. In truth, he is a true European, member of a fast-growing insurgent pan-European right, surfing the same anti-immigrant, anti-liberal, anti-democratic constitution tides as politicians of his ilk are doing across the EU. Almost every European country now has a Faragist making the political weather \u2013 with one key difference. None wants to repeat Britain\u2019s disastrous experience and leave the EU. Unintentionally, Farage has done the European cause one great service.\n\nYet, as Spain\u2019s Vox, with its roots in Franco\u2019s fascism, hopes for success in the imminent elections, echoing what Giorgia Meloni, with her Brothers of Italy\u2019s comparable roots in Mussolini\u2019s fascism, achieved last year by becoming prime minister, mainstream European politics quivers. Liberals and the left are in retreat before parties that celebrate the primacy of family and faith, oppose same-sex marriage, want a crackdown on immigration and multiculturalism, do not believe in climate change, critique all things woke, and, above all, believe their nation is more special than any other. Parties in almost every country in Europe repeat the refrain, climb in the polls and are either in national or regional government (Finland, Denmark, Austria, Sweden, Poland, Italy, Hungary) or soon could be (Germany, France, Holland, Spain).\n\nMore ominously, if they could lift the constraints, they would follow the lead of Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n and reinvent their democracy to allow only their party to rule, eliminating an independent judiciary and a free press, all in service of the rightwing cause. Poland\u2019s Jaroslaw Kaczy\u0144ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are trying to copy Orb\u00e1n and take Poland back to its Catholic conservative roots. But whatever the populist right\u2019s attack on the basic constructs of a democratic order or their passionate view that they and only they are right, nobody adds leaving the EU to their programme.\n\nOrb\u00e1n only pushes his pro-Putin views so far: he may need Russian energy, but he needs EU money more\n\nThat is reinforced by the Russia-Ukraine war. Both French nationalist Marine Le Pen, who won more than 40% of the presidential vote in 2022, and Meloni were once happy to fawn over the Russian despot. After all, Putin regards homosexuality as a sin, claims to venerate Christianity, takes the toughest line on Muslims and celebrates the blood and mystic sanctity that constitutes the Russian nation state.\n\nBut his barbarous invasion of Ukraine has turned him from the right\u2019s moral soulmate into a political leper. When Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, calls for Nato help, it makes no political or security sense for even an extreme-right EU politician to refuse it. Equally, Ukraine\u2019s insistence on wanting to join the EU to reinforce potential Nato membership, so completing its formal membership of the west, underlines \u2013 even to the right \u2013 that the EU treaty architecture they live within has to be upheld. Orb\u00e1n only pushes his pro-Putin views so far: he may need Russian energy, but he needs EU money more.\n\nPutin and Brexit have become the two hard rocks that define the limits of the populist right\u2019s political ambitions. The good news is that the EU is going to hold together and Putin will be opposed, as long as the German centre can hold the line against the AfD, the extreme rightwing insurgent. Here, the powerful constitution will save both Germany and Europe from neofascist ambitions. But that still leaves the continent as a kind of playpen \u2013 strong enough to continue but too weak to stop basic democratic principles and values from being flouted.\n\nTake Meloni. She has read the runes and is pro-EU, pro-Nato and anti-Putin, a stance for which, given her background, she wins plaudits.\n\nBut that only gives her political cover to prohibit efforts to search for stricken immigrant boats, entrench symbols of Italian nationhood and culture, attack same-sex marriage and sack those suspected of being liberal sympathisers in the public broadcaster. It is baby-step fascism that prefigures more. Her manifesto declared that Europe should be a confederation of \u201chomelands\u201d.\n\nBritain had its rightwing spasm in Brexit, with its roots in disaffection at loss of control, social neglect, appeal to old glories and ache for system change; now we confront the protracted clearing up of the economic and social debris. Our populist moment, Johnson aping Orb\u00e1n in challenging the supreme court in the name of we the people, has passed.\n\nBut the direction of European politics will continue to affect us. Europe\u2019s rightwing lurch and a weakened EU centre means the already slim chances of getting a better trade deal in 2026 are growing slimmer. The immigration pressures that forced the recent collapse of the Dutch government over the rights and wrongs of limiting asylum seekers are not going to lessen.\n\nBut for all that, ultra-rightwing politics will retreat. Ultimately, people want prosperity, security and fairness, not performative politics aimed at regression. The right are poor at running modern capitalist economies well or facing the reality that the climate and environment are degenerating before our eyes. Truth will out. Hard-won personal freedoms are not going to be relinquished: women across Europe are not going to give up abortion rights, nor gay people the right to marry. Hating the other burns out eventually. Ways will be found to manage immigration with decency.\n\nHere Britain, curiously, could emerge as something of a model. Neither neofascism nor social conservatism has widespread appeal. Our prime minister may be British Asian but few care: what matters is what he does. Starmer\u2019s Labour has the opportunity of a generation: to turn the economy around, meet today\u2019s grand challenges while retaining our great liberal open culture. Success will be defeat for Europe\u2019s right: democracy and capitalism shown to work. It will be our ticket to be readmitted to the heart of what will still be a great club that will emerge stronger, if battered. What we are living through is all part of the process: building Europe. Take heart.",

            "text": "Richard Curtis, Emma Thompson and Deborah Meaden are among celebrities who have called on Wimbledon to end its new partnership with Barclays over the bank\u2019s multibillion-pound support for fossil fuel projects.\n\nAs the 2023 championships get under way on Monday, the group claims the sponsorship deal, reportedly worth at least \u00a320m a year, is damaging the club\u2019s reputation.\n\nIn an open letter to Sally Bolton, the chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), the campaigners said: \u201cPut simply, Barclays is financing and profiting from climate chaos, and accepting a sponsorship deal from them is an endorsement of these actions.\u201d\n\nCaroline Lucas, the Green party MP, retail consultant Mary Portas, Dr Mya-Rose Craig, the British-Bangladeshi ornithologist also known as Birdgirl, and Christiana Figueres, who was head of the UN climate change convention that achieved the Paris agreement adopted in 2015 and effective from 2016, are among those who have signed the letter. Greenpeace UK, the Big Issue Group and Global Witness are also backing the campaign.\n\nThe multi-year partnership was announced in November with Barclays replacing HSBC after 15 years. Curtis and the letter\u2019s other signatories argue that the deal is \u201cinconsistent with Wimbledon\u2019s cultural legacy and environmental policies\u201d.\n\nIn recent years, the club has announced a range of sustainability measures and set ambitious targets to mitigate the climate crisis. In April, it announced it was piloting a refillable water system on court for the first time.\n\nBut critics of the Barclays deal have accused the club of greenwashing. Campaigners said the bank had given more than $38bn (\u00a330bn) to oil and gas companies, including Exxon Mobil, Shell and TotalEnergies, in the last two years. The figures come from the Banking on Climate Chaos report, published in April.\n\nCurtis, who founded Make My Money Matter, which campaigns on banks and oil firms, said: \u201cWith the great respect and love for Wimbledon \u2013 and all the magic from Billie Jean King to Andy Murray \u2013 the decision of the AELTC to partner with Barclays is a very bad line-call.\n\n\u201cBarclays is Europe\u2019s largest fossil fuel funder, providing over $190bn to the industry since the Paris climate agreement in 2016. They are also a set behind their peers like HSBC and Lloyds: they\u2019ve failed to rule out direct financing for new oil and gas, the most important commitment of all now.\n\n\u201cBy agreeing a new sponsorship deal with Barclays, Wimbledon is damaging its reputation, failing to meet public expectations and endangering our wonderful green planet, that they\u2019re meant to embody.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting very late in the day to tackle the climate crisis \u2013 we\u2019re at the semi-finals now \u2013 and so it\u2019s time for Wimbledon to knock Barclays out of the competition by dropping them as a sponsor.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

            "text": "11.20 EDT Afternoon summary\n\nA quick recap\n\nBusiness and trade minister Kemi Badenoch has said \u201cWe need to make sure that Thames Water as an entity survives,\u201d as questions mount over the future of the UK\u2019s largest water company.\n\nIt emerged last night that contingency plans for the collapse of Thames Water are being drawn up by the UK government and the industry watchdog amid fears that Britain\u2019s biggest water company cannot survive because of its huge debt pile.\n\nEnvironment minister Rebecca Pow had pledged that water supplies to Thames Water\u2019s 15 million customers will be protected, whatever happens.\n\nShe told the Commons:\n\n\u201cOverall the water companies are considered resilient, but there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes with Thames Water to ensure that customers will not be impacted. \u201cAnd there is a process in place if necessary to move us to the next stage.\u201d\n\nSeveral Labour MPs said that water privatisation had failed, with companies racking up debts on their books and paying out lucrative dividends, while failing to invest in infrastructure.\n\nDarren Jones, who chairs the Business and Trade Committee, said that Thames Water showed the failure to run and regulate the sector properly.\n\nJones told the Today Programme:\n\nFor too many years, decades even, we\u2019ve allowed these companies to be operated with high risk stakes, with high levels of debt, with wealth being extracted from the companies, with investment not being high enough. And then, once again, we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re being told that customers, taxpayers are going to have to pick up the bill for a failure of good corporate behaviour at these companies, and by the sounds of it poor regulation.\n\nA former Thames Water executive told the Guardian that the water company faces \u201cintractable\u201d problems which are rooted in \u201cover 100 years of underinvestment\u201d.\n\nThames Water, though, insists it is \u201ccontinuing to work constructively with its shareholders\u201d over its funding needs.\n\nWater companies are also planning large increases in customer bills, to fund tens of billions of pounds of investment in infrastructure.\n\nElsewhere today\u2026.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt has held a meeting with the UK\u2019s economic regulators, to see how they can help ease the cost of living crisis.\n\nAt Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, Rishi Sunak told MPs:\n\n\u201cThe Chancellor met with all the economic regulators this morning and they will be making an announcement later about their plans to ensure fairness of pricing and supply chains to ease the burden on consumers.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s top central banker, Andrew Bailey, has said he understands why the Bank of England is criticised, and declined to ensorse market forecasts of more rate rises.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, has said the BoE failed to forecast the scale of the UK\u2019s inflation shock because its assumptions become \u201cunworkable\u201d in a crisis.\n\nSoaring mortgage rates and the cost of living crisis are forcing more sellers to accept lower offers to secure a property sale, according to Zoopla.\n\nEmma Fildes, property buyer and advisor at Brickweaver, tells us:\n\nThe Spring market showed short lived promise as the quarterly growth rate in house prices turned positive. Yet inflation was quick to burst that bubble at the \u201ccore\u201d leaving many a first-time buyer struggling to raise enough of a deposit to offset any dent in house prices. Many have retreated in anticipation of further price falls and hope for rates to stabilise next year. This is seemingly supported by Zoopla which expects prices to fall by a conservative 5% over the course of the year. Despite this, buyers remain proactive when a discount is applied. This is coming largely for buyers who could either afford to top up their deposit (with the help of mum and dad, savings or buyers with a good rate already fixed in). The alternative of watching wages diminish in rent remains unappealing versus getting on the ladder if there is a financial step up. Meanwhile cash buyers are circling, some watching and waiting out sellers\u2019 misguided pricing or pouncing on the needy as more properties come to the market. This influx of properties will further reduce prices as those who can afford to buy play their position off comparable properties.\n\nThe UK advertising watchdog has banned campaigns by Toyota and Hyundai for exaggerating the speed at which electric cars can be charged and misleading consumers about the availability of rapid-charging points across the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe boss of Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker, Pascal Soriot, has warned that the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss are damaging the planet and human health, as it announced a $400m (\u00a3310m) plan to plant 200m trees by 2030.\n\nThe energy regulator has announced a proposal to make new rules brought in to protect struggling prepayment meter customers a compulsory part of suppliers\u2019 licence conditions.\n\nWhile the communications regulator Ofcom has launched an investigation into BT after technical faults hit the 999 emergency call service on Sunday.\n\nAnd in banking, UBS is reportedly preparing to cut more than half the 45,000 staff it inherited from the takeover of stricken rival Credit Suisse, in a move that is expected to begin as early as next month.",

            "text": "The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has withdrawn his endorsement of wood-burning stoves promoted as \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d after a surge in sales of the appliances, which contribute to harmful air pollution.\n\nIn 2018, Khan endorsed the Ecodesign stoves, which comply with new regulations in an EU directive on minimum energy efficiency standards that came into force on 1 January last year, in order to encourage householders to switch from open fires and older stoves to more modern technology. He said Londoners could make a big difference by using the \u201cright kit\u201d.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s endorsement \u2013 along with the government\u2019s clean air strategy, which also supported more efficient stoves \u2013 is used to promote the sales of modern wood-burning stoves, often bought primarily to enhance the attractiveness of a home.\n\nWood-burning stoves emit toxic particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which can be drawn deep into the lungs, increasing the risks from cardiovascular and respiratory disease. In 2019, exposure to these tiny toxic particles in the UK was linked to 33,100 premature deaths from all sources of pollution, including wood-burning stoves.\n\nEmissions of PM2.5 from domestic wood burning increased by 124% between 2011 and 2021. Wood burning in homes now produces more small particle pollution than all road traffic in the UK.\n\nKhan \u2013 who faces scrutiny over the extension of the ultra-low emission zone in London after Labour\u2019s byelection defeat in Uxbridge and South Ruislip last Thursday \u2013 has confirmed he is withdrawing his endorsement of wood-burning stoves after being challenged by the Liberal Democrats over the issue.\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor said: \u201cThe mayor has made it one of his top priorities to tackle the twin dangers of London\u2019s air pollution and the climate crisis.\n\nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan endorsed the use of Ecodesign stoves in 2018, but has now withdrawn his approval. Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cDue to the increasing evidence of the harmful impacts of air pollution, including from wood-burning, the mayor no longer endorses Ecodesign wood-burning stoves or any other form of solid fuel burning.\u201d\n\nThe Stove Industry Alliance, which promotes the wood-burning stove industry, has removed his recommendation from its website, but it still appears elsewhere. Marketing material for Schiedel, a leading manufacturer, stated last week: \u201cStoves are good!\u201d and that they are \u201csupported by ... the mayor of London\u201d.\n\nData from the Stove Industry Alliance shows UK stove sales of its members rose from 143,160 in 2021 to 200,428 last year, a 40% increase.\n\nHina Bokhari, a Lib Dem London assembly member, said: \u201cI\u2019m grateful that the mayor has revoked his endorsement. Domestic wood-burning is one of the main sources of PM2.5, the most harmful of all pollutants that leads to a variety of respiratory and cardiac illnesses and has even been linked to dementia.\u201d\n\nOne Ecodesign stove emits a volume of dirty pollution particles an hour equivalent to six modern diesel heavy good vehicles travelling at 20mph for an hour, according to an analysis in 2017 by the government\u2019s air quality expert group. The stove industry says Ecodesign stoves emit a fraction of the polluting particles from an open wood fire or older stove.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More people have put in stoves.\n\n\u201cI think some people just imagine the smoke goes out in the chimney and just is magicked away. People don\u2019t understand that smoke doesn\u2019t just go up in the air. It spreads out in a plume engulfing your closest neighbours.\u201d\n\nGary Fuller, an air pollution scientist at Imperial College London, said: \u201cThe current messaging around the burning of wood seems to indicate it\u2019s OK if you use a modern stove.\n\n\u201cWhether you use an open fire to burn wood, which is illegal in many of our urban areas, or invest in a stove for solid fuel, it is the most polluting way to heat your home.\u201d\n\nEcodesign stoves are less polluting, but still emit 465 times more particle pollution than a gas-fired boiler, according to data in the chief medical officer\u2019s report on air pollution.\n\nThe stove industry says data comparing emissions of Ecodesign stoves with vehicle emissions and other sources of energy is \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d. It says these comparisons do not account for the fact that most stoves are only used for a few hours a day.\n\nA spokesperson for the Stove Industry Alliance said: \u201cParticulate matter comes from many different emissions sources and the UK stove industry is committed to continuing appliance improvement and innovation to drive down emissions and improve efficiency even further. Modern Ecodesign-compliant stoves burning dry wood account for less than 0.1% of total UK PM2.5 emissions and produce up to 90% less emissions than an open fire and up to 80% less than older, basic stove models. Wood is a sustainable and renewable fuel source.\u201d\n\nSchiedel said it had removed a reference to the mayor\u2019s recommendation from its website.",

            "text": "An ability to surprise is not, perhaps, the first thing people typically associate with Germans. But looking at the direction our country has taken since Russia launched its war of aggression against Ukraine, maybe we Germans have managed to surprise even ourselves.\n\nOnly two years ago, billions of cubic metres of gas arrived from Russia to Germany through Nord Stream 1 and other pipelines. Russian fossil fuels made up a large share of our energy consumption. Today, we\u2019ve cut this down to zero.\n\nOnly two years ago, the idea of Germany delivering tanks, air-defence systems and howitzers to a war zone would have seemed far-fetched, to say the least. Today, Germany is one of the leading arms suppliers for Ukraine\u2019s self-defence.\n\nNot only is there a sea change in how my country perceives the threats to its own security, but also in how we understand our responsibility in today\u2019s world: as a leader our partners can rely on.\n\nAfter the horrors of the second world war, unleashed by Germans, our country\u2019s foreign policy was driven by the premise that war should never again emanate from German soil. In a first phase of foreign policy, after 1945, my country sought to regain former enemies\u2019 trust. We are forever grateful that they extended their hand to us, readmitting us into the global fold.\n\nThe following decades\u2019 developments are too complex for justice to be done to them here. Certain markers stand out for me, however. For decades, German governments pursued what came to be known as \u201cchequebook diplomacy\u201d \u2013 the belief that our cash rather than our soldiers should help resolve conflicts.\n\nThe 1990s brought a third phase, gradually first through participation in UN-led missions and then \u2013 driven by the unbearable images of the Balkan wars \u2013 much more robustly through Germany\u2019s active involvement in the Nato-led force in Kosovo. It was not despite our country\u2019s history that this decision was important, but because of it. As the then foreign minister Joschka Fischer pointed out: Germany\u2019s responsibility for the Shoah meant not only a commitment to \u201cnever again war\u201d, but to \u201cnever again Auschwitz, never again genocide\u201d. A commitment to the values of the UN charter, as well as to international criminal law, meant that Germany has supported its partners in UN missions across the globe. After 9/11, Germany stood with the US and its partners as it deployed the Bundeswehr to Afghanistan.\n\nWhat I believe has fundamentally changed in the face of Russia\u2019s onslaught on Ukraine, however, leading to a fourth phase of foreign policy, is the way we perceive threats to our own security, at the heart of Europe. Our security is not a given. For too long, we did not listen to the warnings of our eastern neighbours who urged us to take the threats emanating from Russia seriously. We learned that \u201choping for the best\u201d is not enough when dealing with an increasingly autocratic leader. Besides all our efforts to construct a European security architecture with Russia, our economic and political interaction also did not sway the Russian regime toward democracy.\n\nJust after the outbreak of the war, a schoolgirl in Vilnius, Lithuania, who lives only a short drive from the Russian and Belarussian borders, asked me: \u201cCan we count on you?\u201d I wholeheartedly answer: you can. We Germans will never forget that we owe our freedom in a reunited country also to our allies and our eastern neighbours. Just as they were there for us, we will be there for them now, because the security of eastern Europe is Germany\u2019s security.\n\nWe know that for the foreseeable future, President Putin\u2019s Russia will remain a threat to peace and security on our continent and that we have to organise our security against Putin\u2019s Russia, not with it. In Germany\u2019s first-ever national security strategy, we lay out how we seek to assume our responsibility in this new phase of foreign policy, in Europe and beyond, through an integrated security policy.\n\nFirst of all, that means stepping up our commitment to our Euro-Atlantic family. We are strengthening Nato as the guarantor of our collective security. We are beefing up our military capacity with an unprecedented \u20ac100bn (\u00a386bn) package and committing to Nato\u2019s defence spending target. We are building a geopolitical European Union that is opening its doors to new members, such as Ukraine, Moldova, the western Balkan countries and, in the long term, Georgia.\n\nWe learned painfully that security means not only protection from war and crises, but also from economic vulnerabilities. Decisions on where we buy our gas, oil, or technology carry security implications. We therefore prepare not to repeat past mistakes. Systemic rivals are seeking to expand their spheres of interest by using their economic clout. While we believe that decoupling from China is not an option in a globalised world, we strive to de-risk and to reduce our vulnerabilities. Diversification is an investment in security.\n\nWe are therefore strengthening our strategic global partnerships. And if we want our common rules \u2013 based on the UN charter \u2013 to govern our world in the future, we have to prove their worth, advancing solutions that serve our partners\u2019 needs \u2013 on questions of security, trade and the fight against the climate crisis. If we fail in that, others, who do not share our firm commitment to international law and human rights, will step in.\n\nRussia\u2019s war of aggression has marked a rupture in the world. For my country, it has opened a new chapter, redefining how we seek to promote peace, freedom and sustainability in this world: as a partner that embraces its leadership.\n\nTo some, that may be surprising. More importantly, I believe, it is a question of responsibility.\n\nAnnalena Baerbock is Germany\u2019s minister for foreign affairs",

            "text": "The smoke-grey skies over T\u00e1bara were turning furnace orange as \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn forced down the ham sandwich that had been pressed on him by his friends at the petrol station and ran to his excavator.\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Monday 18 July last year, the 53-year-old builder\u2019s yard owner had been watching the wildfires in the Sierra de la Culebra in north-west Spain creep closer to his town for eight hours, waiting to see whether his trucks and diggers could help fight the blaze.\n\nA little before 3pm, the flames arrived on the edge of T\u00e1bara and Mart\u00edn made the quick, selfless decision that would lead to his death three months later.\n\nHis actions, captured on a video that went around the world, would yield some of the starkest and most disturbing images of the scorching and deadly European summer of 2022, the hottest on record.\n\n\u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn died from his injuries when he tried to dig a firebreak to stop the spreading wildfire in the Spanish town of T\u00e1bara on 18 July 2022. Photograph: Guillermo Martinez/Reuters\n\nMinutes after climbing into his excavator to try to dig a firebreak to halt the blaze, Mart\u00edn and his vehicle were swallowed by the flames and the drifts of thick, black smoke.\n\nA few agonising seconds later, the video showed him somehow managing to stumble and run out of the inferno, his clothes consumed by the flames. He had suffered burns to 80% of his body.\n\nRescuers bundled Mart\u00edn into a car and drove him to a nearby health centre, from where he was taken by helicopter to a hospital in the city of Valladolid. Despite the best efforts of medical staff, however, the man hailed in the press as el h\u00e9roe de T\u00e1bara died from his injuries in the early hours of 25 October 2022.\n\nAlmost a year after the fires hit \u2013 and following its driest April to date \u2013 a drought-struck Spain is bracing for another summer of wildfires and heat-related deaths as the realities of the climate emergency become increasingly inescapable across the Iberian peninsula and beyond.\n\nTemperatures this week are forecast to reach 44C (111F) in parts of the country as the second heatwave of the summer bites. In T\u00e1bara, the memories of last July are raw and the trees around the town still charred black.\n\nT\u00e1bara on 18 July 2022. Photograph: Montse Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco\n\n\u201cIt all happened in just 15 minutes,\u201d says Montse Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco, who was working at the petrol station that day.\n\n\u201cThe whole town was in pieces. Everyone loved \u00c1ngel. He was such a lovely person and he was always ready to help anyone with whatever they needed. We all hoped he\u2019d make it; you never lose hope. But he didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nAs T\u00e1bara\u2019s mayor, Ant\u00f3nio Ju\u00e1rez, puts it, \u201cwhat nobody wanted to happen happened. We all know each other in this town and \u00c1ngel was a guy who was always ready to help other people and pitch in. What he did to try to save the town is proof of all that.\u201d\n\nJu\u00e1rez, a forestry engineer and volunteer firefighter, says the causes of the wildfires are not hard to fathom. He refers to T\u00e1bara and the surrounding areas as \u201cthe ground zero\u201d of what has come to be known as la Espa\u00f1a vaciada \u2013 the hollowed-out Spain.\n\nA few decades ago, there were almost 2,000 people in T\u00e1bara; today it has just 770 inhabitants, most of them older people. The draw of the big cities has led to depopulation, which, in turn, has led to profound changes in the surrounding landscape.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio J\u00faaraz, the mayor of T\u00e1bara, said people were still grieving after the wildfires in 2022. Photograph: Sam Jones/The Guardian\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing more and more is the loss of the ties that bind people to the land,\u201d says the mayor. \u201cNew sources of energy, together with depopulation, mean that people scarcely use the forests: there\u2019s no longer a firewood season or people making charcoal. That means the forests are becoming exponentially overgrown.\n\n\u201cIn places where there were once a few oak trees, there are now oak forests. Places where there were once pastures are now scrublands. There\u2019s less livestock and there are now no goats here that used to live off the land.\u201d\n\nAll of which means that there is far more vegetation to burn. Add to all that an extremely dry year, strong winds and a lack of fire-fighting equipment, \u201cand you get what we endured last year. It was, in the widest sense of the phrase, a perfect storm\u201d.\n\nLocal residents tried to help put out the wildfire in T\u00e1bara, July 2022. Photograph: Bernat Armangu\u00e9/AP\n\nJu\u00e1rez\u2019s summary tallies with the findings of a new report from Greenpeace that warns the effects of the climate emergency in Spain will be as far-reaching as they will be devastating.\n\n\u201cProjections indicate that if Spain does not cut severely the emissions that cause global warming, the country will become hotter, drier, more arid and flammable,\u201d says Maria Jos\u00e9 Caballero of Greenpeace Spain. \u201cIt will experience more floods and high-intensity fires and the impacts of sea level rise.\u201d\n\nAccording to EU figures, the 2022 wildfire season was the second worst on record, with blazes devouring 1,624,381 hectares \u2013 an area of land roughly equivalent to Montenegro. In Spain alone, wildfires burned through 315,705 hectares.\n\nJofre Carnicer, a professor of ecology at the University of Barcelona and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says the wildfires already seen in Spain, Australia and Canada are a taste of things to come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to increase our capacity when it comes to prevention but we\u2019re also going to find that there are limits when it comes to adaptation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing some kinds of fires whose virulence and simultaneous natures require tools that human society doesn\u2019t always have.\u201d\n\nIn Spain, wildfires burned through 315,705 hectares. They raged through the hermitage of the Virgen del Valle de Toledo, Castilla la Mancha, Spain in July 2022. Photograph: Ismael Herrero/EPA\n\nWhile investing in rural areas and forest management is key, Carnicer says the best way to mitigate the effects of the climate emergency is by reducing emissions.\n\n\u201cThe scientific consensus is that the best stabilisation strategy is a drastic reduction in emissions in the next 10-20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be easy, but the more we do, the braver and the more drastic the action we take, and the better the public and private financing is, the better the scenario will be.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s environment minister, Teresa Ribera \u2013 who has already pointed out that \u201call the money in the world\u201d won\u2019t fix the damage done by a failure to reduce emissions \u2013 also believes that last year\u2019s events in the Sierra de la Culebra will become more and more common.\n\n\u201cIn places where the climate is in transition \u2013 such as the Iberian peninsula \u2013 big fires are probably one of the most real, frequent, important, damaging and painful threats that climate change brings,\u201d she says.\n\nAlthough Spain\u2019s 17 regional governments are responsible for responding to wildfires in their own territories, the central government has 60 aircraft, 200 specialist firefighters and a military emergencies unit that can be deployed to supplement their efforts.\n\nSpain deployed specialist firefighters to help tackle recent blazes in Chile and Canada, with Spanish firefighters battling fires in the Rivi\u00e8re Boisvert, northern Quebec, in Canada on 24 June 2023. Photograph: Miteco/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs well as working to improve preparation, enhance civil protection measures and professionalising and increasing human resources, Spain has also deployed some of those specialist firefighters to help tackle recent blazes in Chile and Canada.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just need to cooperate when it comes to sharing experience with other neighbouring countries \u2013 it\u2019s also important that we strengthen our rapid response capacity for when it\u2019s needed in different countries that we might not immediately think of as those most affected by these risks but which, as time goes by and the accumulated effects of climate change pile up, will also find themselves vulnerable to this kind of phenomenon,\u201d says the minister.\n\nIn T\u00e1bara, where the sky is now blue and the summer air hot and dusty, the mayor says the best way to avoid a repeat of last year\u2019s tragedy would be to reintroduce livestock grazing to keep the land clear. More fire-fighting equipment, water points, lookouts and planning would also help.\n\n\u201cThe authorities haven\u2019t known how to adapt to these circumstances,\u201d says J\u00faarez. \u201cThey haven\u2019t tackled the demographic problems and they haven\u2019t known how to manage the forests. And they haven\u2019t been able to foresee just how virulent these fires can be or provide the necessary means of fighting them.\u201d\n\nThe people of T\u00e1bara, he adds, are still grieving. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do or what to say. This wasn\u2019t a dream you can wake up from. It was reality and there\u2019s now a sadness here in people\u2019s everyday lives.\u201d\n\nMontse Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco works in the local petrol station and was a friend of \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn, who died of his injuries after he tried to stop the fire spreading in 2022. Photograph: Sam Jones/The Guardian\n\nBack at the petrol station, Montse Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco sells cold cans to her thirsty customers and thinks, as she often does, about her friend \u00c1ngel.\n\n\u201cWe still talk about him a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I remember his jokes and what a good, happy person he was. The thing is he would have done it again because that\u2019s what he was like.\u201d",

            "publish_date": "2023-07-27T00:00:00",
            "text": "The recent collapse of the Russia-Ukraine grain deal spells disaster for millions. The year-old deal has allowed 1,000 ships to export food products from Ukraine by sea, including 80% of the grain going to the World Food Programme. The biggest recipients of Ukrainian grain have been China, Spain, Turkey and Italy, but 57% of it went to 14 countries currently defined as most threatened with starvation, including Afghanistan, Sudan, Yemen and the war-hit Horn of Africa.\n\nRussia has stopped Ukraine\u2019s food exports through the Black Sea, citing multitudinous western sanctions imposed on its own trade. Although these do not include farm products, Vladimir Putin says that if sanctions imposed since the 2022 deal are rescinded, he will resume the deal. Meanwhile, he is telling African leaders at his summit in St Petersburg this week that he will replace Ukraine\u2019s grain with his own. This is unlikely to happen; nor can the EU realistically replace sea transport with land transport.\n\nEverything Putin says may be lies. The Kremlin is a monument of mendacity and its recent bombing of Odesa\u2019s grain warehouses is an obscenity. Destroying food has nothing to do with the ground war in Ukraine, any more than does sinking grain tankers trying to run the gauntlet to Turkey. But the fact remains that grain is not getting out to those who most need it. These are people who have nothing to do with this war and are distant victims of its escalation by the west through the toughest trade sanctions ever imposed on a big and complex modern economy.\n\nCommon philanthropy demands that Putin\u2019s offer be put to the test. Sometimes, deals must be done with the devil. Western sanctions have been wholly ineffective in influencing the course or possible outcome of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. It is hard to discern how far they have even harmed Russia\u2019s civilian population, while they have imposed a high price on European energy users through Russia\u2019s wholly predictable retaliatory sanctions. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development even reckons the Russian economy will next year return from shrinkage to expansion. It is already calculated, by the IMF, to have a growth rate that exceeds the UK\u2019s. The west is thus trapped into continuing a failed policy for no other reason than that pride forbids it to stop. Meanwhile, those most affected \u2013 global consumers of Ukraine\u2019s food exports \u2013 must suffer. This cannot be right.\n\nI have asked for, but failed in all attempts to find, evidence that the UK government \u2013 or, I assume, any western government \u2013 did any forecast of the consequences of sanctions before imposing them. Elementary economics should have predicted that Russia\u2019s huge dollar reserves, reputedly about $650bn, would protect its economy from severe damage. Predictable too was the impact of retaliatory sanctions on European energy and food prices.\n\nWas this never discussed? It would have been far better to concentrate all resources on aiding Ukraine on the battlefield. The modern economic sanction is a weapon not unlike America\u2019s A-bomb in the film Oppenheimer: its rhetoric, its potency and its capacity to cause harm so exhilarates its creators that there is little thought given to its practical consequences or moral implications. It becomes an article of faith as much as a weapon of war \u2013 and as such unchallengeable.\n\nHenry Kissinger and many diplomats before him argued that sound foreign policy often involves painful choices between competing evils. This is as true today as it was during the cold war. Backstairs understandings must be reached and channels must be kept open. Just now the world is grappling with climate crisis. But how seriously? It should surely mean persuading China to reduce its voluminous carbon emissions and to continue exporting metals vital to the green economy. What is the point of the west waging a low-intensity trade war against Beijing, with added vilification? Is a marginal risk to British security really more important than global heating? Likewise, abhorrence of Putin in Ukraine should not stall all dealings with Russia whatever the collateral cost.\n\nPhilosophers may be able to invent some algorithm that balances good and evil consequences in a country\u2019s relations with the outside world. When Britain joined the Afghan and Iraq wars, such an algorithm might have avoided the mix of self-righteousness, neo-colonialism and military glamour that drove policy at the time. Hundreds of thousands died as a result. The diplomacy of those wars was barely an advance on that preceding the first world war.\n\nThe deaths now being suffered in Ukraine are Putin\u2019s direct responsibility. If hundreds of thousands more die elsewhere, he must also share the blame, but the root cause of much misery will be the western sanctions that he regards as justification for so many malign actions. It must be worth pulling every possible lever to get him to relent \u2013 even if it bruises the west\u2019s faith in its most beloved weapon of aggression, the economic sanction.\n\nThis article was amended on 28 July 2023 to clarify that Poland hasn\u2019t blocked Ukrainian grain from passing through its territory.",

            "publish_date": "2023-07-08T00:00:00",
            "text": "It\u2019s fair to say elements of the UK\u2019s political establishment and rightwing media don\u2019t much like Joe Biden. The US president was accused of being \u201canti-British\u201d when visiting Northern Ireland in April. Conservative commentators sneered uneasily at subsequent scenes of him playing to the crowd in Ballina, his family\u2019s ancestral home in County Mayo, as he recalled how his forebears fled famine-stricken (British-ruled) Ireland for a better life in America.\n\nWhat really annoyed rightwing critics was that Biden visited Dublin on that trip, winning standing ovations in the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, but didn\u2019t find time to come to Westminster. \u201cI\u2019m at home,\u201d he declared in Ireland\u2019s capital. \u201cI just wish I could stay longer.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely Biden will feel the same way on Monday when he makes a brief stopover in London to meet Rishi Sunak and King Charles, en route to Nato\u2019s Ukraine crisis summit in Lithuania.\n\nFar from rolling out a verbal red carpet, Biden\u2019s detractors have been busily writing him off. The list of his allegedly egregious transgressions includes declining to give Brexiters the prized US-UK free trade agreement they promised voters, quipping that he had travelled to Belfast to \u201cmake sure \u2026 the Brits didn\u2019t screw around\u201d with the peace process, turning up late for Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral last September and not turning up at all for the king\u2019s coronation in May.\n\nSuch criticisms, politically unrealistic, petty and over-sensitive, provide a clue as to why the US \u2013 and not just the Biden administration \u2013 has difficulty taking Britain seriously these days. The UK isn\u2019t the global player it once was, whatever Tories may say. By leaving the EU, it has lost the influence and leverage in Europe the Americans valued. Geopolitically, the UK is stuck up a blind alley. Its \u201ctilt\u201d to the Asia-Pacific impresses neither Washington nor Beijing. Cuts in overseas aid and the anticipated failure to honour climate funding pledges further undercut British soft power.\n\nBiden\u2019s blocking of Ben Wallace as the next Nato secretary general is a reflection not on the defence secretary\u2019s record but on the UK\u2019s diminished standing and clout. It\u2019s not a reason to sulk. Rather, it is a timely reminder of a political reality that Sunak, like his delusional predecessors, Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, seems unable to grasp. Viewed from Washington\u2019s hard-nosed perspective, the relationship with Britain, while still useful in limited ways and historically resonant, just isn\u2019t that \u201cspecial\u201d any more. Naturally, the Americans do not say that out loud. On the contrary, the White House is at pains to stress \u201cthe close relationship between our two nations\u201d. Biden, 80, an old-school, moderate Democrat whose father was a used-car salesman, has been typically generous in trying to build bridges to the inexperienced Sunak, 43, a millionaire from a very different political background. Perhaps he is just relieved that Johnson, \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump\u201d, is out of the way.\n\nThe Atlantic declaration agreed between Biden and Sunak in Washington last month, which will supposedly encourage cooperation on new technologies such as AI, advance bilateral trade, and enhance economic security and data protection vis-\u00e0-vis China and Russia, was an example of Biden\u2019s goodwill \u2013 and political nous. The declaration sounded important. It gave Sunak something to crow about. But it is largely lacking in substance. Mostly, it replicates agreements the US has already made with the EU.\n\nDespite the slightly false bonhomie, there is no hiding the fact the two leaders\u2019 views diverge in fundamental ways. Biden is a veteran warrior for economic and social justice. Sunak exhibits scant idea of what that means. Specifically, Biden thinks, rightly, that Brexit was a foolhardy error that has needlessly damaged the UK, the EU and transatlantic cohesion; he believes, correctly, that its bungled terms stoked tensions in Northern Ireland; probably feels, with justice, that Britain is only beginning to come to terms with some bitter imperial legacies; and quite reasonably distrusts Trumpian populist tendencies on the British right.\n\nIronically, but not entirely surprisingly, all that suggests this US leader may be more in tune with the current state of British public opinion than Sunak, his tone-deaf ministers and a Conservative government that has long outstayed its welcome. Rather than mock Biden for his gaffes, his age, his filial embarrassments and his faux-Irishness, Britain, and especially the Tories, would do well to heartily welcome him \u2013 and recognise his achievements at a time of hugely challenging global discord and domestic strife.\n\nBiden has achieved more radical change at home in just over two years than Barack Obama did in eight. His successes include the $1.9tn Covid-19 relief bill, a $1tn national infrastructure renewal package and the most ambitious climate law in US history, which boosts green energy and healthcare. The White House says about 13m jobs have been created since he took office, pushing unemployment to a 50-year low. He also persuaded Congress to adopt major gun safety legislation.\n\nBiden has faced setbacks, too, not least a series of regressive decisions by the US supreme court, including on abortion rights. He\u2019s blamed, unfairly, for high inflation. And overseas, he mishandled the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Yet, fortunately for British and European security, his leadership over Ukraine has been strong and steady. How do his rightwing detractors think Russia-loving Trump would have managed this crisis? They may find out after next year\u2019s presidential election. Those who like to rubbish Biden should be careful what they wish for.",

            "publish_date": "2023-07-27T00:00:00",
            "text": "Walking on a busy London street recently, I heard a shout. \u201cDon\u2019t hit me,\u201d a cyclist screamed, as a Land Rover driver reversed into his path. Next, it was my turn to jump out of the way. The driver lurched forward, veering unexpectedly in my direction just as I was crossing a sidestreet.\n\nA moment later, another panicked voice behind me; a little girl scooting in front of her mother overshot the pavement ever so slightly, and came just inches from the driver\u2019s path. Behind the steering wheel the driver appeared impassive, apparently unaware of the consternation in her wake.\n\nPerhaps you could dismiss this incident as an example of simple bad driving, but SUVs represent a unique danger on our cities\u2019 roads. Their popularity has boomed in recent years. Drivers are drawn to the higher road position that offers a feeling of security. But research from the US has found that while SUV drivers are involved in fewer collisions overall, when they crash into children, the collisions are eight times more likely to be fatal.\n\nMore than 120 modern cars available to purchase on the UK market now overhang standard parking spaces, claiming ever more of our public space. These hulking vehicles were originally designed for off-road driving. And advertising campaigns featuring rugged terrains would have you believe this is how many are still being used. But in the UK, the overwhelming majority of drivers do not buy them to drive off-road: three-quarters of these vehicles end up polluting city streets, with a high proportion concentrated in the affluent west London borough of Kensington and Chelsea.\n\nAlongside their growing popularity, there is also a determined momentum to crack down on their usage in European cities. In Paris, officials will introduce new parking charges next year for larger and heavier vehicles. Noting there are no dirt paths or mountain roads in the city, David Belliard, its deputy mayor for public space and mobility policy, said SUVs are \u201cdangerous, cumbersome and use too many resources to manufacture\u201d.\n\nIn the UK, after the tragic collision at a Wimbledon school involving the driver of an SUV, after which two children died, the European Transport Safety Council called for a ban on SUVs in populated areas. \u201cDo people need two-and-a-half-tonne vehicles to take their children to school?\u201d, said a spokesperson. \u201cLondon has done a great job on restricting the movement of freight vehicles. There is no reason why you could not look at restrictions on these types of vehicles too.\u201d\n\nAnd yet banning SUVs is unlikely to be simple. For manufacturers, they have far superior sales margins compared with normal cars. Since 2018, manufacturers have been spending more on marketing for these vehicles than standard cars, sometimes more than all their other cars combined.\n\nAnd the ads work. In the 10 years to 2018, SUVs went from a 7% share of the EU car market to 36%. They now make up half of all car sales in Australia, and 46% of global car sales, according to data from 2022, at a time when other car sales were dropping.\n\nFritz Gahagan, a former marketing consultant for tobacco, could have been talking about ads for SUVs when he said: \u201cThe problem is how do you sell death \u2026 you do it with the great open spaces \u2026 the mountains, the open places, the lakes coming up to the shore. How could a whiff of a cigarette be of any harm in a situation like that?\u201d\n\nThe global tobacco epidemic was fuelled by savvy marketers to devastating effect. According to a small study in Australia, SUV fuel consumption may in fact be between 16% and 65% higher than advertised, and yet ads still present them as desirable vehicles, associated with beautiful landscapes and adventure. We must start challenging this faux reality.\n\nWhat those ads leave out, among other things, is the fact SUVs use on average a quarter more energy than medium-size vehicles. They generate almost 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions annually \u2013 the amount by which we overshot our Paris agreement targets. Their increasing adoption is directly contributing to the climate crisis, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nCampaigns such as Badvertising and Comms Declare are calling for increased regulation of the way SUVs are marketed because of their substantial negative impact on our efforts to meet carbon-cutting targets. But there is more to be done to diminish their presence. Let\u2019s start with charging drivers who insist on owning large vehicles proportionately to their damage to our roads, our safety and environment. This could be through vehicle excise duty (car tax) and road-user pricing \u2013 a per-mile road user levy.\n\nLevers such as low emission zones may be causing tensions politically, but the evidence shows they work to clean up city air. We could follow the example of our French neighbours; the city of Bath, which is consulting on emission-based charges; and London councils such as Islington and Tower Hamlets, which have introduced higher charges for parking the most polluting vehicles. If these measures end up costing people more, why not pass the cost back to the companies responsible?\n\nThe horse may have bolted on SUV ownership, but we do have tools at our disposal to discourage people from driving these dangerous vehicles. Now is the time to put our foot down.",

            "text": "Sir Norman Foster, 88, is one of the world\u2019s leading architects. His works include Apple\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley, the Gherkin in London and the Sage music centre in Gateshead. His Norman Foster Foundation, based in Madrid, aims to \u201chelp new generations of architects, designers and urbanists to anticipate the future\u201d. A major retrospective of his work is currently on show in the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and Norman Foster: Complete Works 1965-Today has just been published.\n\nYour exhibition is the largest that the Pompidou Centre has ever held on architecture. The new book is more than 1,000 pages over two volumes. Is the aim to make a definitive statement of your work?\n\nFirst of all they were both invitations. It\u2019s great that the Pompidou was prepared to devote so much space to the subject of architecture. So it was an opportunity to raise awareness of architecture and the infrastructure of cities. And to give insights into the creative processes beneath the surface \u2013 to show that something that looks very simple, like the circular building we did for Apple, has come out of studying many options.\n\nThere\u2019s a drawing in the book that you did as a student, that shows the workings of a wooden windmill in meticulous detail. What is its significance to you?\n\nI was always curious about how something works, in the case of the windmill the inner workings, the cogs, how the wind power was transmitted eventually to the stones that would grind the grain. I think that that comes round to how do you find a basis for design. It\u2019s not just how the materials work but \u2013 whether it\u2019s a museum or a corporate entity \u2013 what are the values, what makes it tick below the surface. How can that be reflected in the architecture? How can the architecture enable it to work better?\n\nWhat was it like to work with Steve Jobs on the Apple headquarters in Silicon Valley?\n\nSteve had that rare ability to think across a great scale. To be at one point on his hands and knees and worrying about an outlet socket, at the other end thinking ahead for his enterprise. With the design of that building we were trying to achieve harmony of inside and out, that synchronisation of internal and external geometry which suddenly clicked and became a eureka moment.\n\nAerial perspective gives you insight into spaces that you know: streets and squares, the mindless sprawl\n\nDid you learn things from him?\n\nIt was more like a reaffirmation, working together. We did a series of full-size prototypes looking at 12 different types of white glass, looking to see which one was the whitest of the white, so I think it was a shared quest for doing the best building that we were capable of doing together.\n\nYour book has drawings of the 75 different flying machines \u2013 gliders, biplanes, jets \u2013 that you have piloted. What does flying mean for you?\n\nFirst the romance. You may know the mechanics of flight but that doesn\u2019t really explain the magic of a heavy machine levitating into the sky, that moment of breaking free from gravity. And then it would be the aerial perspective that gives you the insight into the spaces that you know, the traditional streets and squares, the mindless sprawl, the sheer beauty of nature.\n\nIs there anything that you haven\u2019t flown yet, but would like to?\n\nI suppose in another life it would have been exciting to fly the ultimate high-performance machines, which are of course fighters.\n\nThere is a chapter of your book called Alpine. You ski and you have a home in St Moritz. As a boy you used to cycle from Manchester to the Lake District. What do you love about mountains?\n\nThe sheer majesty, the grandeur, the scale, the quality of light. It\u2019s the drama, the extreme contrasts, and the physical engagement, whether that is through cross-country skiing or a gravel bike or a mountain bike or a road bike.\n\nAn aerial view of Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California. Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters\n\nDo you feel most at home in the mountains, in St Moritz?\n\nHome in many ways is where I am. When I\u2019m here in London I really feel at home and I think the same is true when I\u2019m in Madrid. But if I\u2019m in the Alps that\u2019s where most of my books are, it is where I have a drawing set up and I can come back and resume it.\n\nAre these books on architecture, art, philosophy\u2026?\n\nA total mixture: they can be on camouflage, on streamlining, on cities. I\u2019m just putting together a selection of books that I\u2019m having sent out for the summer because I will spend the next few weeks based in America. I move around to the west coast, to Texas. It\u2019s a ritual we do every summer.\n\nWhich book would you take with you if your house was burning down?\n\nImpossible to answer. The ones that I\u2019m bringing together now are very much statistical, about how successively the future is always better than the past. On energy I find Vaclav Smil fascinating. Steven Pinker, whose Enlightenment Now looks at the progress of civilisation \u2013 why we are more civilised now than we were in the past despite a lot of media of the moment that would suggest otherwise.\n\nObviously there\u2019s a lot of pessimism about climate especially, but you don\u2019t share that?\n\nI share the concern and the sense of urgency. But it seems to me, although this as a statement creates an element of derision, that we need an abundance of clean energy. We know statistically that the cleanest form of energy is nuclear. That is within easy reach. And we know that we can create jet fuel out of sea water and decarbonise the ocean at the same time.\n\nYou grew up in a great manufacturing city, Manchester, which by then was in decline. In your book you reproduce a painting of the region by LS Lowry. What do you see when you look at a Lowry \u2013 something depressing?\n\nNo not at all. My wife gave me as a birthday present a very early Lowry from 1935 and it\u2019s almost like the agenda of what he did later in his life. I think there\u2019s an extraordinary humanity in those neighbourhoods, in those streets. Maybe I\u2019m romanticising but I think of the work ethic in the north. I think about values. I came out of a background of hardworking parents.",

            "text": "Europe\u2019s cheap flights and pricey train tickets promote dirty forms of transport, campaigners say, with \u201coutrageous\u201d tax breaks encouraging people to heat the planet as they head on holiday.\n\nTrain tickets are double the price of flights for the same routes, on average, according to an analysis from Greenpeace published on Thursday. The campaigners compared tickets on 112 routes on nine different days. To get from London to Barcelona, they found, the cost of taking the train is up to 30 times the cost of jumping on a plane.\n\nHoliday destinations across Europe this week have been baking in deadly heat made hotter by greenhouse gases released from burning fossil fuels.\n\n\u201c\u20ac10 airline tickets are only possible because others, like workers and taxpayers, pay the true cost,\u201d said Lorelei Limousin, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace. \u201cFor the planet and people\u2019s sake, politicians must act to turn this situation around and make taking the train the more affordable option.\u201d\n\nFlying is one of the most polluting activities a person can do and also one of the hardest to clean up. Unlike eating a burger or driving a car \u2013 which have cleaner alternatives such as plant-based meats and electric vehicles \u2013 there is no way to fly without changing the climate. Experts have criticised schemes claiming to offset emissions from flying as flawed.\n\nThe Greenpeace campaigners found train travel was more expensive than flying, on average, on 79 of the 121 routes they studied. On many routes, there were individual days where the train was cheaper than the plane, even if the average cost was greater.\n\nTrains beat planes on eight or nine of the nine days tested on 23 of the routes. Half of these were deemed \u201cgreat\u201d for having regular and reliable connections, a good speed and tickets below \u20ac150.\n\nThe best lines include Lisbon-Porto and Madrid-Barcelona for domestic travel, and Berlin-Prague, Zurich-Vienna and Prague-Budapest for international travel. None of the top international train lines involved the UK, France, Spain or Italy.\n\nOverall, the study was \u201cwell done\u201d and considered complexities in the system such as the time of booking, said Stefan G\u00f6ssling, a professor at Linnaeus University in Sweden who has studied flight emissions. \u201cThat said, the findings do not come as a surprise, as air transport is highly subsidised.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, airlines pay no taxes on kerosene and little tax on tickets or VAT. Their emissions are only priced for flights within Europe \u2013 at a level below the social cost of carbon. A study published earlier this month by Transport and Environment, a green campaign group, found European governments lost out on \u20ac34.2bn from poor taxation on aviation in 2022. The \u201ctax gap\u201d is set to rise to \u20ac47.1bn in 2025, the report found.\n\n\u201cIn short: if you fly, you are subsidised; if you take the train, you are punished by higher prices \u2013 as well as the fact that the journey is often longer,\u201d said G\u00f6ssling.\n\nThe aviation industry is responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon pollution but releases other gases that heat the planet further. A study co-authored by G\u00f6ssling found only 11% of the world flew in 2018, and at most 4% flew abroad.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

            "text": "Top players in the development of artificial intelligence, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI, have agreed to new safeguards for the fast-moving technology, Joe Biden announced on Friday.\n\nAmong the guidelines brokered by the Biden administration are watermarks for AI content to make it easier to identify and third-party testing of the technology that will try to spot dangerous flaws.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Biden said the companies\u2019 commitment were \u201creal and concrete\u201d and will help \u201cdevelop safe, secure and trustworthy\u201d technologies that benefit society and uphold values.\n\n\u201cAmericans are seeing how advanced artificial intelligence and the pace of innovation have the power to disrupt jobs in industries,\u201d he said. \u201cThese commitments are a promising step that we have a lot more work to do together.\u201d\n\nThe president said AI brings \u201cincredible opportunities\u201d, as well as risks to society and economy. The agreement, he said, would underscore three fundamental principles \u2013 safety, security and trust.\n\nThe White House said seven US companies had agreed to the voluntary commitments, which are meant to ensure their AI products are safe before they release them.\n\nThe announcement comes as critics charge AI\u2019s breakneck expansion threatens to allow real damage to occur before laws catch up. The voluntary commitments are not legally binding, but may create a stopgap while more comprehensive action is developed.\n\nA surge of commercial investment in generative AI tools that can write convincingly human-like text and churn out new images and other media has brought public fascination as well as concern about their ability to trick people and spread disinformation, among other dangers.\n\nThe tech companies agreed to eight measures:\n\nUsing watermarking on audio and visual content to help identify content generated by AI.\n\nAllowing independent experts to try to push models into bad behavior \u2013 a process known as \u201cred-teaming\u201d.\n\nSharing trust and safety information with the government and other companies.\n\nInvesting in cybersecurity measures.\n\nEncouraging third parties to uncover security vulnerabilities.\n\nReporting societal risks such as inappropriate uses and bias.\n\nPrioritizing research on AI\u2019s societal risks.\n\nUsing the most cutting-edge AI systems, known as frontier models, to solve society\u2019s greatest problems.\n\nThe voluntary commitments are meant to be an immediate way of addressing risks ahead of a longer-term push to get Congress to pass laws regulating the technology.\n\nSome advocates for AI regulations said Biden\u2019s move is a start but more needs to be done to hold the companies and their products accountable.\n\n\u201cHistory would indicate that many tech companies do not actually walk the walk on a voluntary pledge to act responsibly and support strong regulations,\u201d said a statement from James Steyer, founder and CEO of the non-profit Common Sense Media.\n\nThe guidelines, as detailed at a high level in a fact sheet the White House released, some critics have argued, do not go far enough in addressing concerns over the way AI could impact society and give the administration little to no remedies for enforcement if the companies do not abide by them. \u201cWe need a much more wide-ranging public deliberation and that\u2019s going to bring up issues that companies almost certainly won\u2019t voluntarily commit to because it would lead to substantively different results, ones that may more directly impact their business models,\u201d said Amba Kak, the executive director of research group the AI Now Institute.\n\n\u201cA closed-door deliberation with corporate actors resulting in voluntary safeguards isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Kak said. \u201cWhat this list covers is a set of problems that are comfortable to business as usual, but we also need to be looking at what\u2019s not on the list \u2013 things like competition concerns, discriminatory impacts of these systems. The companies have said they\u2019ll \u2018research\u2019 privacy and bias, but we already have robust bodies of research on both \u2013 what we need is accountability.\u201d\n\nVoluntary guidelines amount to little more than self-regulation, said Caitriona Fitzgerald, the deputy director at the non-profit research group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic). A similar approach was taken with social media platforms, she said, and it didn\u2019t work. \u201cIt\u2019s internal compliance checking and it\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the FTC consent orders from the past when they required Facebook to do internal privacy impact assessments and they just became a box-checking exercise.\u201d\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has said he will introduce legislation to regulate AI. He has held a number of briefings with government officials to educate senators about an issue that\u2019s attracted bipartisan interest.\n\nA number of technology executives have called for regulation, and several went to the White House in May to speak with Biden, vice-president Kamala Harris and other officials.\n\nSenator Mark Warner said the guidelines released on Friday are a start but that \u201cwe need more than industry commitments\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile we often hear AI vendors talk about their commitment to security and safety, we have repeatedly seen the expedited release of products that are exploitable, prone to generating unreliable outputs, and susceptible to misuse,\u201d Warner said in a statement.\n\nBut some experts and upstart competitors worry that the type of regulation being floated could be a boon for deep-pocketed first-movers led by OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, as smaller players are elbowed out by the high cost of making their AI systems known as large language models adhere to regulatory strictures.\n\nThe software trade group BSA, which includes Microsoft as a member, said on Friday that it welcomed the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to set rules for high-risk AI systems.\n\n\u201cEnterprise software companies look forward to working with the administration and Congress to enact legislation that addresses the risks associated with artificial intelligence and promote its benefits,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nSeveral countries have been looking at ways to regulate AI, including European Union lawmakers who have been negotiating sweeping AI rules for the 27-country bloc.\n\nThe details of the European legislation are still being hashed out, but the EU AI Act contains robust regulations that would create significant consumer protections against the overreach, privacy violations and biases of certain types of high-risk AI models.\n\nMeanwhile conversations in the US remain in the early stages. Fitzgerald, of Epic, said while the voluntary guidelines are just one in a series of guidelines the White House has released on AI, she worries it might cause Congress to slow down their push to create regulations. \u201cWe need the rules of the road before it gets too big to regulate,\u201d she said.\n\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, recently said the United Nations was \u201cthe ideal place\u201d to adopt global standards and appointed a board that will report back on options for global AI governance by the end of the year.\n\nThe United Nations chief also said he welcomed calls from some countries for the creation of a new UN body to support global efforts to govern AI, inspired by such models as the International Atomic Energy Agency or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe White House said on Friday that it had already consulted on the voluntary commitments with a number of countries.\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this story",

Any history of the industrialised world\u2019s culture \u2013 scientific, technical, literary, military, philosophical, global-entertainment \u2013 has to accept the multiple creative impact of German emigration over the two previous centuries. But its best known and most spectacular source has been forced emigration, as David Blackbourn confirms. The whole world, not only America and Britain, was fertilised by the torrent of intellectual brilliance that fled Germany and Austria in the 1930s. Less well known is the earlier outflow of refugee liberals and socialists, politicians, writers or barricade fighters, after the counter-revolutions that followed the great uprisings of 1848. Most headed for the US, where many Union commanders in the civil war would be Germans who had learned their trade in Baden or the siege of Vienna. The thinkers and revolutionaries often joined London\u2019s swarm of political \u00e9migr\u00e9s.\n\nThese German currents, and especially their Jewish element, were intellectual and entrepreneurial. They taught the British, for instance, new ways to invent, design, travel, make love and stay fit. But Germany in the World recalls that \u201cordinary\u201d Germans, especially peasants, had also been emigrating by the tens of thousands all through the 19th century. At first they moved into prosperous north-west Europe, including Britain (Victorian London and Liverpool were overcrowded with German waiters and clerks). But as long-distance travel grew easier, five million out of the five-and-a-half million German emigrants that century settled in the US.\n\nIn the century of Enlightenment, Germans again served the rest of the world without much collective agency of their own\n\nAs Blackbourn shows in this rich and full-throated book, the crazy paving of realms that considered themselves German was already well trodden by the rest of Europe in the 16th century. Foreign kings wanted German gunners, German miners (to extract the gold and silver of the New World), German mercenary soldiers and German investment \u2013 above all, from the Fugger banking dynasty in Augsburg. German technology powered the Reformation: \u201cPrinting was the German art and it was Germans who introduced it almost everywhere.\u201d In the 17th century, European emperors and kings unleashed the calamity of the Thirty Years War, which fell above all on the German lands. Grass grew in the streets, cities burned and in some regions half the population perished. A narrative of German victimhood took root, adding to a baleful Lutheran narrative which taught that earthly powers (die Obrigkeit) must be obeyed even when they were satanic. In the century of Enlightenment, Germans once again served the rest of the world without much collective agency of their own. Under the Spanish flag, the Humboldt brothers explored and studied the tropical world; the naturalist Johann Forster worked in Siberia for the tsar and then, with his son Georg, sailed the Pacific with Captain Cook. German sugar planters dominated Surinam (\u201cthis small, mosquito-ridden, cosmopolitan but racially violent colony\u201d), but it remained a Dutch possession. Old subordinate patterns prevailed. At Yorktown in 1781, the decisive American victory over the British, there were so many Hessians and Hanoverians and Ansbachers on each side that it was dubbed \u201cthe German battle\u201d.\n\nAnd yet, in the next age, the eternal lieutenant seemed at last to become a general. \u201cNot long before his death in 1983, the French political philosopher Raymond Aron remarked that the 20th century \u201ccould have been the German century\u201d. By 1900, a united, independent Germany had been created, which had won vast wars against Austria and then France, acquired a navy and tropical colonies, and exported its scientific, technical and intellectual triumphs across the world. Even the self-sure British crowded into German universities. Carlyle, George Eliot, Ruskin and Matthew Arnold set about learning German. \u201cGermany in the world\u201d seemed to be heading for \u201cthe world in Germany\u201d.\n\nA printing workshop c1632: \u2018Printing was the German art and it was Germans who introduced it almost everywhere.\u2019 Photograph: akg-images\n\nBut, of course, \u201cit turned out differently\u2026 The German century became synonymous instead with military aggression and Nazi dictatorship, above all with the Holocaust\u201d. Blackbourn, the professional historian, asks \u201cWhen did it all start to go wrong?\u201d rather than \u201cWhy?\u201d. Many would answer his question with \u201c1914\u201d, appointing Germany as the primary culprit for the first world war. Blackbourn\u2019s account of the \u201cJuly Crisis\u201d, which ended in war, is careful and vivid, but not identical to Christopher Clark\u2019s contested verdict in The Sleepwalkers (2012), which stated that: \u201cThere is no smoking gun in this story; or rather, there is one in the hands of every major character.\u201d In Blackbourn\u2019s version, what emerges is not any deliberate German nudging towards war so much as the criminal stupidity and recklessness of German leaders handling the crisis. Their caste hated Germany\u2019s old romantic image as a dreamy land of \u201cthinkers and poets\u201d (Dichter und Denker); they demanded a \u201cplace in the sun\u201d for their \u201cbelated nation\u201d and their paranoid sense of victimhood was confirmed after the war by the brutality of the 1919 Versailles peace settlement. The dazzling modernisms of the Weimar Republic probably excited the outside world more than the Germans. But the Nazi dictatorship that followed was, in Blackbourn\u2019s phrase, \u201cthe party of negation\u201d, defined by what and whom it rejected \u2013 which included influences from most of the \u201cnon-Aryan\u201d globe. \u201cGermany in the world\u201d soon narrowed to mean only world war, genocide, destruction and then partition between Germany\u2019s conquerors.\n\nTwo long concluding chapters cover Germany\u2019s return to the world, as a West German state was steered towards independence by the US and its allies. Interestingly, Blackbourn\u2019s account of the first postwar years lends weight to the notion that the division of occupied Germany owed more to an American decision to dig an anti-communist firebreak across central Europe than to any Soviet strategy. He gives a fair account of East Germany\u2019s desperate efforts to compete with the other state and create a \u201csocialist modernity\u201d. As he says, \u201ceach [state] laid claim to be the \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018better\u2019 Germany\u201d. Here resurfaced an old idealist daydream, born of the failure of the revolutionary Frankfurt parliament in 1848, a failure that allows malcontents in every generation to announce that \u201cthis\u201d Germany is not yet the real thing.\n\nIn 1999, the reunited Federal Republic reluctantly took the step that, in the eyes of impatient allies, finally made \u201cGermany in the world\u201d a reality. German troops were sent to war in Kosovo. But it is Germany\u2019s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine that has shown a new international confidence \u2013 and not just by arming Ukraine with Leopard tanks. Blackbourn\u2019s book takes readers up to Putin\u2019s onslaught. But since then, Europe has watched Germany, led by Chancellor Scholz and his extraordinary Green minister of economy and climate, Robert Habeck, replace total dependence on Russian energy and storm ahead towards ambitious climate targets. All done in months, by a sudden mobilisation of democratic vigour. Germany, at last, gives the world a leadership that threatens nobody.",

            "text": "The UK is edging closer to a deal to allow it back into the flagship \u00a385bn Horizon Europe science research programme after being locked out since 2020 in a row over Northern Ireland\u2019s Brexit trading arrangements.\n\nWhat might happen, and can British science recover its leading position in Europe?\n\nWas there any point to the row?\n\nDebatable. Scientists had nothing to do with the Northern Ireland protocol and the issue had little political capital. Arguably, the only losers were in the sector itself.\n\nIs it over?\n\nNot yet. The UK is close to a deal, sources say, speculating that there could be an announcement on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, next Tuesday.\n\nWhat does the UK say?\n\nDowning Street said a deal had not been agreed between the UK and the EU on the Horizon Europe research programme.\n\n\n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s official spokesperson said the prime minister was keen to seek \u201cvalue for money for taxpayers\u201d if the UK was to rejoin the scheme, with \u201cconstructive\u201d discussions still going on.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect just the past two years, but also the future value that the UK will get from these programmes, and the UK would be a net contributor to the Horizon programme if the decision were made to take that approach. So obviously there are issues that we are discussing and that we continue to discuss with the EU, and we will consider next steps.\u201d\n\nThe EU also says negotiations are continuing.\n\nWhat is the issue?\n\nMoney. The government is concerned that confidence is so weakened in the science sector that the money it pays in will not be matched by awards and it will end up being a net loser.\n\nWhat do scientists say?\n\nThey agree that confidence has taken a knock, but say there is no reason why applications to the fund will not recover with the UK taking a leading role in the programme once again. Physicist and TV presenter Brian Cox said returning to the programme would be \u201ca huge relief\u201d.\n\nCan the loss be quantified?\n\nEU data shows that in 2019, \u20ac959.3m went to the UK in 1,364 grants, compared with \u20ac22.18m in 192 grants in 2023 to date.\n\nHow important was that money?\n\nThere is nothing that matched the scale of Horizon 2020 for scientific research and innovation. The programme had \u20ac100bn (\u00a385bn) to fund projects from 2021 to 2027. These aim to tackle many of the most pressing questions the world faces, from dealing with climate change and protecting the oceans to fighting terminal diseases and improving food and energy security.\n\nBritain has historically received far more back than it has contributed to EU research programmes. Between 2007 and 2013, the UK contributed nearly \u00a34.3bn towards EU research projects and received nearly \u00a37bn in grants. The \u00a32.7bn excess amounted to more than \u00a3300m in research funds each year.\n\nA major report in 2016 found that pre-Brexit, scientific and medical research in the UK was substantially propped up by EU grants, with crucial work on cancer, computing, nanotechnology and engineering all heavily reliant on the funds. European grants made up more than 40% of public money poured into cancer research and 62% of public money spent on nanotechnology research, the report found. Only 7% of funds from the EU and the European Research Council went to non-member states from 2006 to 2015.\n\nBut could the UK not just fund its own scientists?\n\nIt does. The UK Research and Innovation government fund guarantees that it will back scientists who would otherwise have relied on Horizon grants. But the science community argues it is not the same as international collaboration, and the sharing of findings is vital to accelerate advances.\n\nSo what has happened in the past three years?\n\nA protracted political sulk rather than an official dispute after Lord Frost\u2019s decision to unilaterally abandon some of the trading arrangements (since removed under the Windsor framework) relating to Northern Ireland.\n\nAssociate membership, due by normal standards in spring or early summer of 2021, was never ratified by the EU.\n\nIt was simply delayed in an informal retaliatory measure taken over the UK\u2019s failure to implement the Northern Ireland protocol. The EU never announced that it was withholding membership, and it wasn\u2019t until May 2022 that a senior EU diplomat admitted that Horizon Europe \u201cmight be the victim of a political impasse\u201d.\n\nTalks were only reopened in March 2023, when Rishi Sunak and Ursula von der Leyen agreed the new Windsor framework for Northern Ireland.\n\nIs particular research at risk?\n\nDoubts have been raised over whether the UK will seek access to Euratom, a parallel funding scheme for nuclear research and innovation, amid concerns that ministers do not consider Horizon good value for money. The programme operates on the same rules as Horizon Europe and aims to spend \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.2bn) from 2021 to 2025. The funds will drive projects on nuclear fission, safety and radiation protection, but much of the investment is aimed at nuclear fusion, a potentially gamechanging source of green power.",

            "text": "When Labour activists, MPs and unions meet at its \u201cnational policy forum\u201d in Nottingham this month, it will be a novelty to hear what the party is for. The past six weeks have seen the leadership distance itself from key policies. It has already ruled out universal childcare for young children and scaled back plans to borrow \u00a328bn a year to invest in green jobs and industry. Keir Starmer has touted dropping a promise to reinstate the Department for International Development. He still refuses to commit to axing the two-child benefit limit, or to supporting the provision of free school meals for all primary school children. The effect is that he appears to spend more time ruling out all the things that Labour won\u2019t do if it wins power than selling the things it will.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an accident \u2013 it\u2019s entirely deliberate. Labour insiders have suggested the party is actively looking to \u201cmake sacrifices\u201d in areas it had previously flagged as important in order to show its \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d. As strategies go, it is akin to a divorced man burning all his possessions to prove to his ex he doesn\u2019t really want them.\n\nWith inflation still high and the economy struggling, Labour\u2019s leaders clearly feel obliged, in the run-up to the election, to cut back any policy pledges that the Conservatives could label as \u201cunaffordable\u201d. The result is that in doing so they are ruling out anything that is desirable. Britain faces some of its greatest crises since the second world war and Labour is making the case for cautious reserve. Shadow cabinet figures use the language of \u201chard choices\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s possible during these circumstances\u201d, delivered in dead-eyed political jargon. It is opposition by expectation management. Or as Wes Streeting put it in the Observer, \u201cThe only thing worse than no hope is false hope.\u201d Any hope at all would be a start.\n\nWatching Starmer nowadays, it is almost as if there is a concerted effort to be uninspiring. Hope is naive, resignation a sign of maturity. Just look at his response last week to a protester who asked: \u201cWhich side are the Labour party on?\u201d \u201cWe are on the side of economic growth,\u201d Starmer replied, with a straight face. At other times, there appears a bullish attempt to show he doesn\u2019t care about the issues his critics think he would. \u201cI hate tree-huggers,\u201d Starmer reportedly told staff recently during an energy policy briefing.\n\nIt is not that Starmer\u2019s calculations aren\u2019t understandable. The party is faced with the frustration of watching the Tories wipe out tens of billions from the economy and focus groups still asking if Labour can be trusted with their money. There is a reason Starmer and his allies have been courting Rupert Murdoch and other rightwing powerbrokers this summer.\n\nBritish politics is essentially run by a small set of unspoken rules: cuts are better than investment, there is a limited amount of money to go round, and only certain valid ways of raising it. The notion of \u201caffordability\u201d is less genuine economic thinking and more conservative ideology: a device to force mainstream leftwing parties to stick within the parameters of the status quo or be deemed \u201cirresponsible\u201d by the rightwing press. It is essentially the emperor\u2019s new clothes of governing, where cancer patients are dying on NHS waiting lists but we must all pretend \u201climited investment\u201d is the grownup solution.\n\nStarmer did not choose the fiscal rules he inherited \u2013 but he can choose whether or not to play by them. Instead of wincing over scrapping the two-child limit, for example, he could point out that such a move is not only fair \u2013 it\u2019s good economics. Child poverty is estimated to cost the UK \u00a339bn a year and benefit cuts are a key cause.\n\nReports that Labour policy chiefs are considering pushing for ending benefit sanctions and building social housing are a good start. Similarly, Labour could pitch progressive ways to raise funds. Starmer might try increasing income tax for the top 5% of earners (it was, after all, one of his leadership pledges). Labour has dipped a toe in here, pledging to scrap non-dom status and private school tax breaks, but could safely push it to a larger scale. Voters enduring a cost of living crisis are primed for policies that see the wealthiest take their fair share of the burden.\n\nYou can practically hear the response from the leader of the opposition\u2019s office now: Labour hasn\u2019t laid out its policies yet, so it\u2019s unfair to judge the party for them. But it is disingenuous to suggest this is how a narrative works. Starmer\u2019s Labour are not simply defined by what it will stand up for but what it won\u2019t. If the Labour party isn\u2019t comfortable coming out for decent child benefits, universal social care or tackling climate change, it hardly needs a manifesto to show voters what its values are. It has made that quite clear already. After 13 years of Tory rule, the public have every right to expect the opposition to be offering meaningful change. As it stands, \u201cBritain: pretty much like now but slightly better\u201d is the election slogan they will get.",

            "text": "The list of countries calling for a pause on deep-sea mining continued to grow this week ahead of a key moment that mining companies hope will launch the fledgling industry, and its opponents hope could clip its wings, perhaps for good.\n\nIreland and Sweden became the latest developed economies to join critics, including scientists, environmental organisations and multinationals such as BMW, Volvo and Samsung. The carmakers have committed not to use minerals mined from the seabed in their electric vehicles.\n\nNo deep-sea mining contracts have yet been authorised, but efforts by the industry and some states, including Norway, have accelerated the race to mine for metals in the planet\u2019s last unexplored frontier.\n\nIt is a critical time. With a deadline due to expire on Sunday, commercial applications for deep-sea mining could be given the green light despite the absence of any regulations. From Monday, the International Seabed Authority (ISA), the quasi-UN body in charge of those regulations, will meet in Kingston, Jamaica until 28 July to resume negotiations.\n\nMuch is at stake. Scientists have warned of large-scale, severe and irreversible harm to global ocean ecosystems, already threatened by the climate and biodiversity crises, if deep-sea mining goes ahead. Too little is known about the ocean\u2019s abyss even to draw up regulations, they say.\n\nLast month, the European Academies Science Advisory Council warned of the \u201cdire consequences\u201d for marine ecosystems and against the \u201cmisleading narrative\u201d that deep-sea mining is necessary for metals required to meet the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nMining below 200 metres (650ft) can lead to harmful noise, vibration and light pollution. There is also the risk of leaks and spills of fuels and other chemicals used in the mining process.\n\n00:00:43 Undercover footage shows waste from deep sea mining tests discharged into ocean \u2013 video\n\nResearchers this year discovered more than 5,000 new species \u2013 most of them new to science \u2013 living on the seabed in an untouched, mineral-rich area of the Pacific Ocean, known as the Clarion-Clipperton zone, targeted by deep-sea mining firms.\n\nThe tiny Pacific island of Nauru is expected to be the first to apply to the ISA to begin mining, although the country has said it won\u2019t sponsor an application on behalf of The Metals Company (TMC) until after the ISA meets this month. Nauru \u2013 with a population of about 12,000 \u2013 triggered the \u201ctwo-year rule\u201d in 2021 on behalf of Nauru Offshore Resources, a subsidiary of TMC. This request required the authority to complete the mining code by 9 July 2023, or accept mining applications under whatever regulations exist.\n\nCanada-based TMC, formerly known as Deep Green Metals, is partnering with the Pacific states of Nauru, Tonga and Kiribati to explore for deep-sea metals. It has downplayed the impacts and highlighted the need for metals such as cobalt and copper for a transition to clean energy technologies.\n\nThat narrative is disputed by some scientists and environmental groups. They point out that such metals are already mined around the world; that lithium, the key mineral used in many batteries, is not widely present in the deep sea; and that electric vehicle technology is constantly changing.\n\nSweden and Ireland joined a growing list of countries calling for a moratorium, pause or ban on commercial deep-sea mining. They include Germany, France, Spain, New Zealand, Costa Rica, Chile, Panama, Palau, Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has backed a complete ban. Other countries that have not yet supported a moratorium have nevertheless indicated they will not give approval without first agreeing regulations.\n\nSo far, the ISA has allowed companies to explore the deep sea for research purposes only. It has created and adopted regulations to govern 31 exploration contracts, sponsored by 14 nations. As well as Nauru, Tonga and Kiribati, they include China, Russia, South Korea, India, Britain, France, Poland, Brazil, Japan, Jamaica and Belgium.\n\nBut the failure to establish a regulatory framework for commercial mining before the 9 July deadline triggered by Nauru has thrown the ISA into uncertainty, and means all eyes are on the meeting starting next week.\n\nMany critical issues remain to be addressed within the draft regulations, a long document full of temporary text in brackets and marked in red. According to the NGO Pew Charitable Trusts, the ISA has yet to agree what levels of environmental harm would be considered permissible, what would be the criteria for such harm, and how it would assess liability and assign penalties.\n\nIn theory, each of the ISA\u2019s 168 members is involved in its decision making. But in practice, most power lies with a small group of experts known as the Legal and Technical Commission (LTC), made up of lawyers, geologists and diplomats, with few environmentalists. There is no scientific assessment group to vet applications and no inspectorate to ensure compliance. If the LTC recommends that the council approves an exploitation contract, it can be overturned only by a super-majority of two-thirds of the full council, which comprises 36 states.\n\nOther concerns, particularly among smaller island nations and Indigenous communities, which fear being affected most, include how to share the benefits from mining. There is currently no mechanism to do so. At the last ISA meeting three months ago, the head of Belgium\u2019s delegation, Hugo Verbist, warned the authority was \u201csleepwalking into a legally uncertain situation\u201d.\n\nThis time around, the ISA will address a new proposal by France, Chile, Costa Rica, Palau and Vanuatu to pause deep-sea mining until all regulations are in place. If passed, it would act as a moratorium but would require approval by a super-majority, or two-thirds, of the 168 assembly members.\n\nWilliam Hague, a former leader of the Conservative party, this week called for Britain to support the moratorium. The UK has so far pushed only for high environmental standards, and said it would not support any exploitation licences \u201cunless or until\u201d there were enforceable regulations and sufficient evidence to judge the potential impact on deep-sea ecosystems.\n\nProponents of deep-sea mining have questioned whether a moratorium is even legal for the ISA to institute. Under the UN convention on the law of the sea, which set up the ISA, the authority is charged with regulating mining activities and with protecting the marine environment. However, the treaty also specifies that the seabed and its mineral resources are the \u201ccommon heritage of mankind\u201d, and part of the ISA\u2019s remit includes equitable sharing of financial benefits.\n\nDespite the opposition, an executive from TMC has said it expects to file an application in the second half of 2023 with the goal of receiving an ISA mining licence in 2024. Production would start by the end of that year or early 2025.",

            "text": "As they fail on every front, the Tories play the best card they have in their hand: managing expectations. Take this week\u2019s three byelections: every Tory MP you meet says, with a glum face, it\u2019s a wipeout, game over. So if Labour wins Selby and Ainsty, that\u2019s priced in, move on. But if Labour fails to overturn a 20,000 Tory majority, watch the narrative turn to \u201cStarmer\u2019s weakness\u201d.\n\nTime for some perspective. Even the prospect of winning a rock-solid Tory seat should remind doubters of what has been an epic climb by Labour from the despair of its 2019 near-death experience. Labour\u2019s leader had a strategy mapped out from day one, and nothing has distracted him from it: two years to fix the party, ruthlessly expunging any who damage it; a set of five cast-iron missions; and fiscal discipline, avoiding all spending traps ahead of the manifesto. And the result is an astounding 20-point lead. Are Labour people satisfied? Of course not. We see glum faces among the left-leaning commentators, who say Labour will only win as the result of the Boris Johnson and Liz Truss catastrophes. They want to know a Labour government will be transformational, exhilarating, brave, inspired: instead they complain of extreme caution and affronts to Labour values.\n\nBut this is the time to remember May 1997, and how euphoric that Labour victory felt. Understand that the closer Labour gets to the winning post, the greater its fear of one false step, one fatal slip. It won\u2019t matter how excellent Labour\u2019s policies were for the poorest people in Britain if it returns to the miserable opposition benches. Keir Starmer has said from the outset that winning is his purpose.\n\nPublic mistrust of Labour\u2019s management of the nation\u2019s money is why Labour lost and lost again in our lifetimes: fiscal indiscipline is the danger, so we wince as Starmer and Rachel Reeves tighten the bolts on the Treasury chest. But wince we must: the more painful the spending thumbscrew, the more convincing to undecided voters. Though Labour is ahead in polls on every issue and Starmer leads Sunak on every quality, it\u2019s on the economy where the gap is narrowest: Labour analysts fear trust in Labour on tax and spend is softest. That is why virtually no spending promises are being made, and why every question on funding or paying public servants is dead-batted with an apparent pledge to keep within Tory spending plans. It hurts, but there is a point to it.\n\nStarmer\u2019s comments about the two-child benefit cap on Sunday sent shock waves through Labour ranks: the party had attacked it time and again for affecting 1.5 million children, 1.1 million of whom are in poverty, yet now Starmer tells Laura Kuenssberg bluntly: \u201cWe are not changing that policy.\u201d YouGov last week found 60% of British adults it surveyed support the cap, including, alas, a majority of Labour voters. Is Labour selling its soul for votes when it should be persuading people towards more generosity of spirit?\n\nAll this reprises the runup to the 1997 election, when the particularly nasty social security secretary Peter Lilley sang his \u201clittle list\u201d of hates, including \u201cyoung ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue\u201d. He laid a trap for Labour, which had pledged to follow all Tory spending plans: his cut to single parent benefits was to be implemented (like many of Rishi Sunak\u2019s cuts), after the election for Labour to inherit. Unlucky Harriet Harman arrived as the new secretary of state for social security obliged to implement it. Though she softened the cut to apply only to new claimants, Labour felt it had to pass this first test of its honesty. That vote was an early blooding for many new MPs, and some wept on their way into the aye lobby, while 47 rebelled and many more abstained. (Tony Blair rewarded Harman by sacking her a year later.)\n\nKeir Starmer on the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, London, 16 July 2023. Photograph: Tayfun Salc\u0131/Zuma Press Wire/Shutterstock\n\nBut, she told me this week, it was a political and economic necessity. Though the sum was small, \u201cThe international markets were watching our every move to see if we\u2019d renege on our spending promises.\u201d Was it really necessary for New Labour to tie itself so tightly to every Tory plan? In retrospect, I\u2019d say probably not, but hindsight is a fine thing. Ken Clarke, the previous chancellor, laughed and said he had no intention of sticking to his plans. But Tories always escape much scrutiny \u2013 with a mighty media claque to hide behind.\n\nLet\u2019s remember what happened to single parents under Labour after that. Harman\u2019s new deal for lone parents transformed millions of lives and opportunities, with new jobcentres offering support, not castigation; before long, all family benefits rose, as they always do under Labour, with working tax credits and child credits. There were the first ever credits to pay for childcare, enabling many more to take jobs: the support of 3,500 Sure Start centres followed. What will happen to three-child families under Labour? You can bet they and all others on benefits will end up far better off, because that\u2019s what Labour does. But only when it wins.\n\nNow here we are again with hyper-cautious Labour taking no risks and offending its own people. This time, when there\u2019s so much less money than in 1997, voters know promises are not credible unless backed with hard cash. Of course we Labour people yearn for a promise to return to the single market, for wealth taxes and the revival of every moribund public service. But only winning matters, so every obstacle has to be swerved, as the Tories try to turn attention away from their failures on the cost of living, the NHS, the economy and the climate.\n\nLabour will refuse to talk Brexit, electoral reform, benefits, trans rights, renationalisation or anything else distracting, and yes, in our corrupted politics, Labour does have to meet Rupert Murdoch. Rightly, Labour is constantly goaded and provoked to be better, but it\u2019s perverse that complacency over Starmer\u2019s strong lead has become a reason to criticise him for lack of boldness. Critics are too dismissive of his five missions: clean energy, growth through housing and green jobs investment, the NHS, safer streets and opportunity to break the class ceiling. These are at the heart of Labour\u2019s for ever purposes. Fair pay agreements and unions in every workplace are radical. Expect any failing utility or rail company to fall into common ownership, without costing the public billions.\n\nI too yearn for more, always more. But to the glums complaining Labour will be Tory-lite, lacking vision and ambition, remember this: we have just lived through 13 appalling years of austerity vandalism. Remember that every Labour government improves the lives of those with least, raises benefits, raises taxes on well-off people, leaves schools, hospitals and public life better, while every Conservative government trashes those things. Will it be enough? No. It never is. But my bet is that Reeves and Starmer will be bolder than anyone now expects. Without doubt they will do, as New Labour did, far more than they dare promise while tip-toeing towards the finishing line.",

            "text": "At fashion week, there is usually one accessory you begin to spot again and again among the editors and celebrities on the front row. However, during the menswear shows in Paris last week, it wasn\u2019t a particular designer bag or shoe that kept cropping up. It was the new must-have: a mini portable fan.\n\nFrom A-listers to influencers to PRs running around backstage, battery or USB-powered fans were everywhere. Demi Moore watched the Dior show with a black portable fan in hand, while the influencer Bryanboy posted a video of his own \u201cwind machine\u201d at Loewe.\n\nIt\u2019s not just limited to fashion week. A John Lewis spokesperson says searches for small portable fans are up 300% week on week, describing a four-inch foldable version with three speed settings as \u201cgoing viral\u201d. Three out of its four colourways are sold out at the time of writing, and more than 300 buyers have given it a five-star rating.\n\nThe global portable fan market, meanwhile, is expected to grow 3.3% annually from now until 2030.\n\nThe John Lewis portable fan, now sold-out online. Photograph: JohnLewis\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly effective,\u201d says Chandler Tregaskes, Tatler\u2019s style editor who bought a baby pink fan to use at Ascot. \u201cI wanted to keep my cool in navy wool and millinery,\u201d he says.\n\nOf course, fans aren\u2019t exactly a new phenomenon. The Fan Museum in London has over 7,000 examples spanning 1,000 years, and paintings from south-east Asia depict fans from at least the eighth century.\n\nAnd while traditional handheld paper fans continue to be used (at the recent Jacquemus show in Versailles, guests including Victoria Beckham were given cream versions) it\u2019s the rechargeable fans that have really propelled themselves to the top.\n\n\u201cThe gesticulation of the paper fan will never die,\u201d says Tregaskes. \u201cIt\u2019s simultaneously coquettish and fabulous. But for a quick, easy breezy return to chic, the electric fan is where it\u2019s at.\u201d\n\nHowever, this surge in demand for an accessory that attempts to cool the body down hints at a more worrying development. As we continue to feel the effects of climate change, soaring temperatures are becoming more prevalent with each year. In the UK alone, this June is expected to have been the hottest on record. On Sunday, temperatures in some areas reached 32.2C. Nasa, meanwhile, reported that the past nine years have been the warmest years globally since modern record-keeping began in 1880.\n\nVictoria Beckham and David Beckham attend Jacquemus\u2019s dhow at Chateau de Versailles.

If temperatures continue to rise, though, it\u2019s going to take a lot more than a portable fan and \u201cbreathable\u201d fabric such as cotton to keep our bodies cool.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Fashion Statement Free weekly newsletter Style, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solved Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of these fabrics are also made from petroleum, which has a huge environmental impact.\n\n\u201cHeat conducts 38 times faster in dampness than in dry conditions,\u201d says Charles Ross, a sustainability expert and lecturer at the Royal College of Art. \u201cIt\u2019s the effect of sweating that cools the body.\u201d As a result, textiles that actually reduce the temperature of the body \u2013 and which can also be produced in an environmentally friendly, or at least friendlier, way \u2013 are quickly going from a niche area of scientific research to the mainstream. By decreasing the temperature of the body, textiles could, researchers say, one day help reduce deaths from extreme heat.\n\nIn the US, LifeLabs, sells \u00a338 \u201cCoolLife\u201d T-shirts that allow body heat to escape, creating a continuous cooling effect, while scientists in China have developed a \u201cmetafabric\u201d which, in trials, kept the wearer 3C cooler than cotton over a 30-minute period. Both are probably much more effective than a mini fan, despite the latter\u2019s A-list approval.\n\nTo read the complete version of this newsletter \u2013 complete with this week\u2019s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved \u2013 subscribe here to receive Fashion Statement in your inbox every Thursday.",

            "text": "It can\u2019t be easy being Barbie. As if life wasn\u2019t tough enough for an ageing doll with a decorative dimwit for a boyfriend, this week she suffered the indignity of being dragged into a byelection.\n\nOr more precisely, her bright pink classic Corvette did. In easily the most excruciating moment of an already awkward attempt to cling on to Boris Johnson\u2019s old Uxbridge seat, Tory HQ briefly tried to enliven its main line of attack by suggesting to friendly newspapers that if Barbie for some unexplained reason rocked up in the suburbs, she might have to pay \u00a312.50 for breaching mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), due to be extended to the capital\u2019s outer fringes from August. At the time of writing, the voters\u2019 verdict on this one is still hotly awaited. But whatever the outcome, hiding behind a dolly feels like the kind of political low point nobody gets over in a hurry.\n\nThe idea that what the Spectator hopefully calls a \u201cgreat motorist rebellion\u201d against the tree-hugging classes could somehow save the Tories from obliteration at the next general election feels like clutching at straws in a hurricane. For all the sound, fury and mad conspiracy theories flying about over low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which are aimed at stopping motorists cutting through side streets, anti-LTN candidates failed to unseat Labour councillors in Oxford in byelections this spring. However irritating the commuting classes might find Just Stop Oil, most are angrier about the state of their mortgages. All that said, there\u2019s a reason Conservatives seem increasingly keen to play the embattled motorist card all the way through to the next election, if only to limit the scale of their expected losses. For all that Europe is now burning right before our eyes, going green is undoubtedly a harder sell in the middle of a cost of living crisis.\n\nSeven years ago, YouGov found overwhelming support for curbing pollution in cities, emboldening councils to push ahead with planning clean air zones across the country, from Bath and Bristol to Sheffield and Aberdeen. We\u2019d had enough of sweltering in traffic jams and wondering guiltily about all the fumes children must be inhaling as they walked to school; we accepted there was a price to be paid.\n\nBut is that enthusiasm now waning? Polling shows a narrow majority of Londoners still favour expanding the Ulez, but it\u2019s markedly more popular among middle-class professionals than low earners who can\u2019t afford to trade in spluttering old diesels. In Manchester, government plans for a clean air zone were put on hold last year after a furious backlash: the city\u2019s Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, led the attack, arguing that instead of pricing struggling van and taxi drivers off the road if they couldn\u2019t afford to trade in their old polluting vehicles, they should be given financial help to switch.\n\n\u2018In Manchester, government plans for a clean air zone were put on hold last year after a furious backlash: the city\u2019s Labour mayor, Andy Burnham (above), led the attack.\u2019 Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA\n\nA recent poll for the secondhand car site Carwow found drivers still think pollution should be tackled in principle, but in practice 59% said now was not the time \u2013 a line echoed by Labour\u2019s candidate in Uxbridge, Danny Beales, who said he\u2019d heard \u201cheart-wrenching stories\u201d from locals who couldn\u2019t afford new cars. Keir Starmer has notably struggled to muster a full-throated defence of the Ulez in interviews, although it catches only one in five London cars and there\u2019s a \u00a3110m scrappage scheme to help drivers on low incomes upgrade.\n\nSome of the resistance is undoubtedly down to the Mr Toad tendency, enraged by any attempt to prise their hands off the steering wheel. (Though clean air zones aren\u2019t strictly speaking designed to force motorists on to the bus, by painting driving as a filthy, antisocial habit, they undoubtedly offer a hefty nudge in that direction). But there remains an awkward grain of truth in the argument that \u2013 ironically, much like air pollution itself, which is most lethal to the poorest living on busy arterial roads \u2013 clean air zones are toughest on people who can least afford to comply. That means delivery drivers buzzing around on cheap mopeds; white van drivers; shift workers dreading the day their knackered old banger fails its final MOT, because it\u2019s the only way to get home safely in the middle of the night; and also small high street businesses struggling to stay afloat, worried this might be the final death knell for customers driving into town.\n\nNone of this changes the fact that pollution kills, cities need to wean themselves off cars, and the climate crisis poses an existential threat. But if going green costs money that not everyone has, then ultimately there are only two plausible political responses. The first is utterly unconscionable, since it means reneging on net zero. The second is to find the money for a genuinely fair transition, and fast.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about Ulez. There are some alarmingly big bills looming for millions of households in the name of saving the planet, and however clearly people might see the moral case for getting rid of their gas boiler or their old petrol car at a time when forest fires are ravaging Greece and flash floods are hitting Spain, money is money. If you genuinely can\u2019t afford to switch, few things are more alienating than being made to feel guilty about that by people shocked at how hot it was on the beach in Sicily this year.\n\nSo far, net zero targets have relied heavily on the eco-conscious middle classes willingly absorbing the upfront costs of doing the right thing. But for drivers who haven\u2019t yet gone electric, the rocketing cost of living is creating a powerful incentive to hang on to your old car for a year or two longer. Heat pump sales are still worrying low, suggesting homeowners are either burying their heads in the sand or hanging back to see whether they\u2019re really going to be forced to rip out the central heating. There\u2019s a danger of progress stalling just when it needs to accelerate. Unsurprisingly, most politicians are keener to talk about shiny new green jobs or cheap solar energy than about where they\u2019ll raise the money to fund new scrappage schemes and grants. But somehow we must find ways to spread the collective burden of what we all know needs to be done.\n\nFor when the collective good collides with hard-headed self-interest, that\u2019s when the left is perennially in danger of coming unstuck. When times are tough, people start listening to the devil whispering on their shoulder: sure, someone has to save the planet, but does that someone really have to be me? The biggest hurdle for Labour in power will be to show that for once, we really are all in this particular existential fight together.",

            "publish_date": "2023-07-27T00:00:00",
            "text": "In an exclusive interview with Guardian Seascape last Saturday, James Cameron argued that it is \u201cless wrong\u201d to mine the deep sea than mining on land. \u201cI\u2019ve seen an awful lot of seafloor,\u201d said the Titanic director and accomplished deep-sea explorer. \u201cAnd while there are some amazing creatures, they tend to be clustered in small habitats. What you mostly have is miles and miles of nothing but clay.\u201d\n\nHis view, which he conceded made him \u201csomething of an outlier\u201d, is disputed by scientists and environmentalists who claim the opposite: that the ocean floor is a richer and more biodiverse place than previously thought, with new species uncovered each time they look. Deep-sea mining, said one, would result in \u201cextinction on a vast timescale\u201d.\n\nWho is right? That is a key issue at this week\u2019s assembly meeting of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a quasi-UN body of 168 member states tasked with regulating deep-sea mining.\n\nJames Cameron \u2026 film director, ocean explorer and \u2018outlier\u2019 on the subject of deep-sea mining. Photograph: Joanne Mcarthur/The Guardian\n\nLast week, the ISA council \u2013 a smaller group of 36 nations that develops the mining rules \u2013 set itself the goal of allowing mining to proceed within two years. But this week, a growing number of countries, led by France, Chile, Costa Rica, Palau and Vanuatu, is urging the larger assembly to discuss a long term \u201cprecautionary pause\u201d on mining, with a key argument being a lack of knowledge.\n\nFor many decades, the abyssal plain \u2013 where sunlight cannot penetrate and organisms must adapt to cope with extreme pressure \u2013 was considered an underwater desert. The main target of deep sea-mining firms is a particular area of the Pacific between Hawaii and Mexico called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), which is scattered with rocks called polymetallic nodules. They are estimated to contain more cobalt and nickel \u2013 key ingredients in electric batteries \u2013 than all known land deposits.\n\nMining firms such as the Metals Company argue that there is a global benefit to making these minerals available more cheaply, to hasten the transition to green energy and mitigate the climate emergency.\n\nIn the past three months, however, researchers have discovered the CCZ contains far greater biodiversity than previously thought. One recent paper suggested there were more than 5,000 species new to science. Scientists say not enough is known about them to gauge the effect of mining \u2013 or whether it might even wipe them out for ever.\n\n\u201cWhat we know is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d says Muriel Rabone, a data researcher at the Natural History Museum, who found evidence of the 5,000 species. Only six of the species, which includes a sea cucumber, nematode worm and carnivorous sponge, have been seen elsewhere. \u201cWe only know a fraction of what we need to know about these species \u2013 their life, their ecosystem functioning, their traits, their reproductive status \u2013 to be able to predict what the impacts will be.\u201d\n\nAt risk \u2026 a carnivorous sponge, Axoniderma mexicana, flourishes on the ocean floor in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Photograph: NERC/AFP/Getty\n\nThe nodules that mining companies want to bring to the surface take millions of years to form. More than half the species found in the CCZ, which is mainly soft sediment, depend on the rocks as a hard substrate on which to survive. As a result, much of the biodiversity and habitat loss by mining would be permanent. The scientific consensus is that deep-sea mining would cause significant permanent damage to ocean ecosystems.\n\nLack of knowledge is the problem. So far, exploration and research trips have been made only by mining companies, and scientists tend to rely on their surveys in this hard-to-reach zone.\n\nNevertheless, they have made strides in understanding the deep. Following Rabone\u2019s paper, a study this month found that, due to the impact of ocean warming on tropical tuna populations, some of the world\u2019s most valuable fisheries may increasingly overlap with deep-sea mining operations in the CCZ.\n\nWe only know a fraction of what we need to know about these species to predict what the impacts will be Muriel Rabone, ecologist\n\nThere are also potential new discoveries. Bacteria from corals and sponges on the ocean floor can beat superbugs and cancer, and scientists fear losing the vast potential of organisms that are not yet known.\n\nRabone says there is \u201cmassive potential in terms of not just the biodiversity but the value of the biodiversity\u201d. She adds: \u201cWhat we might lose if we mine is an important part of the discussion.\u201d\n\nCameron \u2013 who has discovered several new species on his own, self-funded expeditions \u2013 sees deep-sea mining as the lesser of two evils. He notes that mining on land not only affects \u201chighly diverse rainforest ecosystems\u201d but also Indigenous populations. \u201cSociety,\u201d he says, \u201chas a weird habit of blowing the wrong thing out of proportion.\u201d\n\nA nodule of the kind that has mining companies racing to exploit the seabed. Photograph: Andrew Zuckerman/The Metals Company\n\nHis opinion echoes a recent editorial in the Economist, arguing that deep sea-mining is a less invasive way to get the minerals needed for a green economy. Opponents counter that while Cameron is right about the impact of mining in rainforests, deep-sea mining is highly unlikely to reduce any mining on land.\n\n\u201cSaying it\u2019s better to mine the seafloor than the rainforest is a straw-man argument,\u201d says Rabone. \u201cIn terms of what we don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not just the species that live in the habitat, it is the ecology, and [potential future] uses in terms of socioeconomic value.\u201d\n\nNor is the deep sea a flat, homogeneous plain. Recent topographical maps show it is punctuated by at least 14 undersea mountains, known as seamounts, between 200\u2013500m in height.\n\n\u201dThere is biology there,\u201d says Dr Adrian Glover, a deep-sea biologist at the Natural History Museum and co-author of Rabone\u2019s paper. \u201cIf you look at macrofauna, the diversity is remarkably high. Abyssal plains are high in diversity even if they are low in abundance.\u201d\n\nWhile we have \u201cmassively increased\u201d our knowledge of the CCZ, a lot remains undescribed, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know their biology. It\u2019s hard to predict the extinction rate without knowing where things live.\u201d\n\nScientists fear that noise pollution from mining equipment may affect larger marine life too. Noise from mining equipment could radiate up to 500km (more than 300 miles), harming deep-diving marine mammals as well as ecosystems.\n\nThe latest research is published this week by a team of researchers from 13 institutions led by the UK\u2019s National Oceanography Centre (NOC), which spent a decade examining data. They reveal two distinct zones of deep-sea fauna. Using autonomous underwater cameras, they found a surprising increase in diversity with depth, challenging a long-held belief that biodiversity is limited by harsher living conditions in deeper areas.\n\nA sea cucumber discovered in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Photograph: NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research\n\n\u201cMuddy abyssal seafloors were initially considered almost \u2018marine deserts\u2019,\u201d says Dr Erik Simon-Lled\u00f3, a deep-sea ecologist at the NOC, because of \u201cthe extreme conditions for life there \u2013 a lack of food, high pressure, and extremely low temperature.\n\n\u201cBut as deep exploration and technology progressed, these ecosystems keep unveiling a large biodiversity, comparable to that in shallow water ecosystems, only found on a much wider spatial spread.\u201d\n\nDeeper areas of the plain were dominated by soft anemones and sea cucumbers, they found, while the shallower area was full of soft corals, molluscs and brittle stars. Any future mining regulations will have to take into account that the spread of animals across the area is \u201cmore complex than we thought\u201d, says Simon-Lled\u00f3\n\nAbove all, scientists warn that new discoveries are constantly being made, which means that the true impact of mining has been understated, particularly given the millions of years it has taken the seabed to evolve into its current form.\n\n\u201cThis is a habitat that has been stable for millennia,\u201d says Rabone. \u201cWe know there\u2019s likely to be extinction on a vast timescale.\u201d",

In highly indebted countries, there is a correlation between high levels of debt, insufficient social spending and an alarming increase in poverty rates.\n\n\u201cThere is a human cost of inaction in not restructuring developing countries\u2019 sovereign debt. We need new mechanisms to anticipate and absorb shocks and make the financial architecture work for the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nNext week, finance ministers from the G20 group of countries will meet in India, with the focus being on global health, sustainable finance and tackling poverty.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Escalating borrowing costs and a stronger US dollar are making loan repayments and finance raising significantly more expensive for dozens of developing countries.\n\nLate last month the World Bank proposed that poor countries should be able to pause their debt repayments if hit by climate disaster.\n\nThe UNDP said a pause in repayments, in the short run, would allow countries weighed down by debt to mitigate some of the social effects from economic shocks by using resources that otherwise would have to be used for debt servicing.\n\nGeorge Gray Molina, the chief economist at the UNDP, said such a measure could help countries to stabilise their financial position and help prevent a \u201cfreefall\u201d into poverty.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of a new adaptive social protection architecture to prepare for a future prone to shocks,\u201d he added.",

            "text": "In an idyllic corner of the south Somerset countryside, blackbirds chirrup, cart horses swish their tails and a restless wind susurrates through the boughs of a stand of Douglas firs as a cheery band of twenty-to-fiftysomethings pitch in to gather the hay. But for the reusable water bottles and walking boots, they might be characters in an English pastoral, bowed over their rural labours. \u201cWhen I came here from Brighton I was surprised by how loud it was,\u201d says Meg Willoughby, 28, a resident of Tinkers Bubble. \u201cI had this idea of the peaceful woodland from fairytales, but farm animals are noisy, and when a hill wind blows through firs they make a crazy cracking sound. Nature is wild, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nFounded in 1994, Tinkers Bubble is England\u2019s leading off-grid woodland community: an experiment in rural living that provides low-impact dwellings and a land-based livelihood to a changing roster of 16 residents. In April, it was granted permanent planning permission by South Somerset council, an achievement heralded as a landmark in off-grid communities\u2019 long attempts to be accepted by mainstream Britain (and its planning department mandarins). They celebrated this success in May with song and home-brewed cider. \u201cThough we\u2019re not big drinkers,\u201d Willoughby says, laughing. \u201cWe\u2019re usually back in our cabins with a book by 8pm.\u201d\n\nThe Brithdir Mawr community in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, which welcomes up to 100 volunteers a year. Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Guardian\n\nNamed after an ancient bubbling spring at the site\u2019s south-western edge, Tinkers Bubble occupies a 16-hectare (40-acre) parcel of land, eight hectares of which is evergreen forest. It is owned by a community benefit society, and the current residents, most of whom arrive as summer volunteers, are sustained by the income from a steam-powered sawmill, apple orchard and press (which produces a lively dry cider) and cottage food production, including heritage salad leaves. The community\u2019s 20 dwellings and outbuildings are dotted around a thatched communal roundhouse, all sitting amid the lofty firs. As part of their planning permission, the community is thinning the North American conifers, which were planted for timber in the 1950s, to encourage regeneration in the forest understorey \u2013 the ground-level layer of shrubs and plants. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see native yew saplings return,\u201d Willoughby says.\n\nMoving a tree trunk at Tinkers Bubble. Photograph: Alex Toogood\n\nSelf-sufficient woodland communities are a fringe phenomenon in the pantheon of \u201cintentional communities\u201d (the umbrella term for social units in which members share a dwelling and lifestyle, encapsulating everything from traditional communes to co-housing projects), says Chris Coates, editor of Diggers and Dreamers: The Guide to Communal Living. \u201cFor a start,\u201d he says, \u201cthere isn\u2019t much woodland in Britain compared to places like Bulgaria and Romania [popular spots for founding intentional communities]. Plus, if you\u2019re talking about living self-sufficiently in and from a woodland, it\u2019s hard work, and best suits the young and fit.\u201d\n\nHe adds, however, that for those willing to take a risk with planning permission, the costs can be less than for bricks-and-mortar alternatives. Coates knows of a number of smaller communities and family groups who \u201cfly beneath the radar\u201d, living in pockets of woodland away from local authority oversight.\n\nFormal land-based communities with a woodland aspect include Landmatters, a rural permaculture co-operative in south Devon, set amid 17 hectares of pasture and semi-natural ancient woodland; Coed Talylan, a 28-hectare community on the edge of the Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons), where people live in cabin-style dwellings and run a natural building school and mushroom-growing business; and Brithdir Mawr in Pembrokeshire, a community of 10 adults and seven children on 34 hectares of land, including eight hectares of mature woodland and eight hectares of coppice.\n\nOff-grid discussion groups, meanwhile, bristle with aspirant woodland smallholders looking for land and community members. They include Agatha B, 30, an accountant from Surrey who is buying a pocket of woodland in Wiltshire in the hope of setting up a residential medieval farm. \u201cWe want to make it a bit like [open-air experimental archaeology museum] Butser Ancient Farm,\u201d Agatha says. \u201cBut a real-life version that people live on.\u201d Woodland off-gridders often speak evocatively of Britain\u2019s heritage of woodland dwelling: from the Forest of Arden\u2019s \u201cmelancholy boughs\u201d as the setting for love and intrigue, but also ,shepherds\u2019 hard labour, in Shakespeare\u2019s play As You Like It; and Celtic traditions, in which blackthorn trees are infested by mischievous fairies, ash is nature\u2019s healer and oaks are the sacred old men of the British landscape (the term \u201cdruid\u201d, for the Celtic priestly class, translates as \u201coak man\u201d).\n\nMeg and Alex at Tinkers Bubble. Photograph: Richard Toogood\n\nAlex Toogood, 34, has lived at Tinkers Bubble since 2020 and was instrumental in its successful permanent planning bid. Toogood, who is non-binary, was working as an engineer in London when the pandemic struck, and felt disposable. \u201cI realised that if I left my job one day they would slot someone else into it the next,\u201d Toogood says. \u201cI was a cog.\u201d\n\nToogood arrived at Tinkers Bubble in a lull between Covid lockdowns, via a stint in a Buddhist monastery in Scotland, and here, amid the daily work of tending the vegetable beds and orchards, maintaining the woodland and milking Daisy, the dairy cow, life made sense. \u201cToday everything I choose to do has an impact on the people around me, and on the animals and the land,\u201d Toogood says.\n\nTinkers Bubble residents coalesce naturally into teams depending on their practical aptitudes, Willoughby says, as we chat in the sunshine during her break from tending her flourishing crop of chervil, calendula and sweet grass. She has also been at Tinkers Bubble for two years, and comes from a family of leftist smallholders (her mum runs a community-supported farm agricultural business near Glastonbury). Willoughby spent several years in Brighton before returning, as she puts it, \u201cto the mother trees\u201d.\n\nA horse team looks after the three horses that are essential to the smooth running of this fossil fuel-free \u2013 and therefore car-free \u2013 community. There\u2019s also a cow team, who produce milk and cottage and hard cheese, and care for the new community calf, Bjorn. Carpenter Richard fashions the rakes we are using for today\u2019s hay gathering, and vegetable-growers Toogood and Willoughby contribute to Tinkers Bubble\u2019s food self-sufficiency and sell to local shops. \u201cEvery day I wake up to birdsong and walk through the woods to milk Daisy \u2013 and think how incredibly lucky I am,\u201d Willoughby says. People often drift into Tinkers Bubble in need of nature\u2019s TLC, particularly summer and day volunteers, she says: \u201cThey come broken down and, like me, are brought back to life by nature.\u201d\n\nAlex and Meg stack the carrot crop at Tinkers Bubble. Photograph: Tinkers Bubble\n\nToogood took over one of the community polytunnels in their first week and dug a pond immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s hopping with frogs today, and that makes me proud,\u201d they say.\n\nJenny Pickerill, an environmental geographer who studies land-based intentional communities at the University of Sheffield, says it\u2019s a mistake to dismiss these projects as vestiges of hippy nostalgia. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to project stereotypes on to low-impact rural communes \u2013 that they are isolationist, or living in the past,\u201d she says. She believes the opposite is true: \u201cThese groups are testing radical ways of living that will have applications for all of our futures, whether that\u2019s innovations such as straw-bale housing \u2013 a material that is abundant and perfect for this climate \u2013 or hyper-local food chains.\u201d\n\nToogood believes that a broader shift around environmental issues is making a case for land-based communities. In the latest planning application, Tinkers Bubble \u201cspoke our own language\u201d, rather than attempting to couch their project in \u201cplanning department speak\u201d, as they had in previous applications. (They were awarded temporary planning permission in 1998, 2004 and 2016.) The bid was accompanied by letters of support from the local community, who buy Tinkers Bubble juice, cider and salad, and attend craft demonstrations and folk singalongs in the wood. Local relations have not always been as harmonious. In the 90s, when tensions ran high over the rights of travelling communities, rumours spread that Tinkers Bubble residents were drug-users and thieves. \u201cAnd baby-stealers,\u201d Willoughby says. \u201cTotally bonkers, that one.\u201d\n\nGeorge, Ursa and Heather in a grow house at Brithdir Mawr. Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Guardian\n\nHeather Baker, 34, has lived at Brithdir Mawr since 2019 with her partner, George. Their daughter, Ursa, two, was born in the community, which occupies a mixture of stone and wooden dwellings in 32 hectares of ancient woodland, coppice and pasture in the Preseli mountains of Pembrokeshire, a landscape dotted with the bluestones found at Stonehenge. Brithdir Mawr was granted planning permission in 2008. In 2011, Wales launched its groundbreaking One Planet Development policy, which grants planning permission to low-impact, land-based projects such as Brithdir, which use a fair per capita share of the planet\u2019s resources. Cornwall has been consulting on a similar policy.\n\nI wanted to bring up my own children as part of a tribe, with other adults and children to help to raise them\n\nUnlike Tinkers Bubble, Brithdir Mawr members work outside the community, some as teachers and nurses, others in land-management areas such as seed production. Baker works 20 hours a week at Brithdir, and also part-time at a Steiner school. It was her first career in maternal mental health in Scotland that prompted Baker to seek out a radical new lifestyle. \u201cI saw so much isolation in new mothers,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to bring up my own children as part of a tribe, with other adults and children to help to raise them.\u201d\n\nThe best bit for Baker, however, has been working physically on the land. \u201cWhether it\u2019s cutting wood, plaiting onions or milking goats, it all seems to make more sense than my old nine-to-five life, stressed out and living in a small flat,\u201d she says. Part of Brithdir Mawr\u2019s mandate is outreach. The community hosts 80-100 volunteers a year, who arrive as harried city dwellers to camp, or pay to stay in the community\u2019s trailers and wooden cottages, and pitch in with the land and woodland work. \u201cYou see the transformation immediately,\u201d Baker says. \u201cIt\u2019s ear-to-ear smiles, even if they are just lugging bags of manure.\u201d\n\nWhittling at Brithdir Mawr. Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Guardian\n\nSimeon Warburton, 62, has lived at Landmatters since 2012. A musician, he arrived at the 14-strong permaculture community after leaving London to raise his family on the road and in alternative communities. In 2005, Simeon and his wife, Miranda, 54, set off with their son Izzy, five, and daughter Kuki, two, for what they call their years of \u201croad schooling\u201d: \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear the idea of having to get up every day for the school run,\u201d Warburton laughs. Occupied since 2005, Landmatters was awarded permanent planning permission for temporary housing structures in 2016. Life at the community is based on the ethos of permaculture (an approach to agriculture and settlement that seeks to be self-sufficient and environmentally sustainable) and consuming one\u2019s fair share of the planet\u2019s resources. \u201cBut everyone interprets that mandate in the way they think best,\u201d Warburton adds.\n\nLandmatters\u2019 eight households live in handbuilt wooden cabins, and each have an annual allocation of two cubic metres of wood for personal and commercial use. Simeon and Miranda make wooden totems from their timber and run a solar-powered recording studio at the site. Izzy, 23, and Kuki, 20, live between Landmatters and city lives: Kuki is a tree surgeon and yoga teacher; Izzy is a blacksmith and record producer. \u201cThey had a fortunate upbringing in nature,\u201d Warburton says. \u201cIt has turned them into happy and thoughtful young people.\u201d It can be hard, he admits, to live in a land-based community, which demands energy, effort and a good deal of patience of its members, but the reward, he adds, is reconnection to nature\u2019s rhythms and other people.\n\nSimeon and Miranda Warburton at Landmatters in Devon. Photograph: Kuki Montez Airheart Warburton/@xkooksx\n\n\u201cMy childhood was a life lived in the box of a suburban home,\u201d he says. \u201cHere, life is cyclical: we live among the beeches and oaks, the meadow flowers and insects. In spring and summer we\u2019re busy growing and hosting visitors, and in winter we withdraw and make our crafts.\u201d From his vantage point, Warburton concludes, urban capitalist lifestyles seem odd.\n\n\u201cI get it if you\u2019re working 60 hours a week and winning at that lifestyle and making tons of money,\u201d he says. \u201cThough I would ask if you\u2019re really happy if you\u2019re working all hours at a job you hate and still not making ends meet.\u201d\n\nIn Jenny Pickerill\u2019s view, modern rural lifestyles are the strangest of the lot. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that you need a massive car and oil-fired central heating to live in the countryside,\u201d she says. Low-impact communities such as Tinkers Bubble, she says, propose a socially just and nature-sympathetic model of rural living. \u201cThey show we can live within woodland and harvest bits of it sustainably. We don\u2019t have to fence it off in the name of conservation.\u201d\n\nHay slowly piles up in a wooden cart as Tinkers Bubble residents and volunteers break into song. I depart from this rural idyll, somewhat sheepishly, in a petrol-fuelled taxi driven by south Somerset-born Steve, who regards me quizzically when I say I\u2019ve come from Tinkers Bubble. \u201cWe used to think they were dopeheads and dogs-on-a-string sort of people,\u201d he says. He pauses. \u201cBut I see them these days with their bikes and horses, selling cider and apple juice in the village and \u2013 you know what? \u2013 I think they have got life about right.\u201d\n\nThis article was amended on 14 July 2023 to correct the name of the university that Jenny Pickerill is affiliated to; it is Sheffield, not Cardiff as an earlier version had it.",

This year is kind of crazy. I mean, there are years that are not so hot, but over time the temperatures are rising.\n\nI don\u2019t live nearby the work site so I picked the truck from the company as usual and drove here; with the air conditioning on of course. But I don\u2019t like to sit in the truck and cool down with it on at lunchtime like some guys do, it then just feels worse in the afternoon, the hottest part of the day.\n\nShota Nagasaki, 30, a builder laying concrete in Kawasaki, Japan. 10.30am, 20 July 2023 Photograph: Supplied by Shota Nagasaki\n\nNearly everyone now wears these jackets with the fans built-in, they make a lot of difference. The jackets [which have two battery-operated fans usually around the lower back] have got better over the four or five years I\u2019ve been using them, which is good as the heat is increasing too. It\u2019s a nightmare if you forget to bring it.\n\nOn days when I can\u2019t work in the shade, I also wear a big straw hat, like Luffy from One Piece [a hugely popular manga and anime].\n\nEvery day I\u2019ll drink about three litres of water that I bring in a big canteen, then another three 500ml bottles of drinks from vending machines, sports drinks and fizzy drinks, usually.\n\nI eat the same stuff when it\u2019s hot though, ramen a lot of the time.\n\nWe take this break now at about 10, then lunchtime, then again at three in the afternoon. Other than, it\u2019s work straight through from 8am to 5pm. You can\u2019t take a break just because it\u2019s hot.\n\nIt\u2019s global warming pushing up the temperature. In another 10 years, I guess it\u2019s going to be worse. You need to use air-conditioning but it\u2019s a vicious cycle, the more air-con, the more energy we use, that plus vehicle emissions means more global warming.\n\nIn the future we might need to be using these jackets with fans 24/7.\n\n3pm: Beijing, China\n\nQing, 40, assistant to a film director\n\nQing. Photograph: Handout\n\nToday in Beijing it\u2019s nearly 40 degrees, again. I\u2019m working from home. I mostly stay indoors when it\u2019s this hot. I do not use air-conditioning because my constitution is one that fears the cold. I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll catch a cold from the air-conditioning, or get a headache. I don\u2019t use any hand held fans either. I just try and concentrate on other things to distract myself from the heat.\n\nIn about an hour, I\u2019ll go for a run, probably a 5km in the park near my home. I run in the afternoons because that\u2019s the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s the best way to cool down. I run two or three times a week, then after sweating I take a shower. But if someone wants to try this method they should be in good shape first, and drink plenty of water.\n\nFor breakfast I made potato pancakes, and for lunch I had chicken that I cooked in the air fryer. I wanted to eat chicken because the protein will be good before my run. But in general I don\u2019t have a regular diet, I just eat whatever I have to hand.\n\nThe most important thing in this weather is to drink plenty of water. Today I had a tea made from frozen lychees and dried orchid flowers. I put the frozen lychees into hot water, it\u2019s a bit of a contrast, but I can\u2019t have the iced fruit directly.\n\nA child reaches for vapour from a misting fan to cool down at a street in Beijing. Photograph: Tingshu Wang/Reuters\n\nI always drink plain boiled water. I cannot bear to drink iced water. Perhaps when you drink it, you feel a short-term relief, but later on I find it\u2019s uncomfortable for my stomach. In this way, I\u2019m a bit like an old man.\n\n3.45pm: Gaza City, Gaza\n\nKarim Shehab, 24, business owner\n\nKarim Shehab in his Gaza vape shop. Photograph: Hazem Balousha/The Guardian\n\nI have been running a vape shop in Gaza City for almost two years, but since the summer started, working in the shop has been difficult. I live with my four brothers, three sisters and parents. We have no privacy, as sometimes we all sleep in the same room that has an air conditioner.\n\nToday, I was unlucky with the electricity. It was cut off all night so I was mostly on the rooftop till early morning. When I came to the store at noon, with the temperature 34 degrees, the air conditioner was working, but the power went off after one hour and now I\u2019m depending on a battery-powered fan.\n\nSummer started early this year and it\u2019s hotter than usual. Gaza\u2019s issues are double that of other places that witness high temperatures, because there have been continuous power outages since 2006 [after Israel unilaterally withdrew from the area], and during peak times in summer and winter, the hours of outages increase. The electricity problem has increased this summer, with barely six hours per day.\n\nPalestinian children swim in a swimming pool to cool down amid a heatwave in Gaza. Photograph: Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters\n\nIn the morning I wake up to find myself drenched in sweat. If the electricity is cut off and the air conditioner is not working, I run to the bathroom to take a shower.\n\nI spend my day searching for electricity, going between my shop, my house, friends\u2019 houses and public places, until late at night. We are a coastal city, so it is still very humid at night. I call around to find out where there is air conditioning I can use. I often sleep in different places, depending on the temperature and the availability of electricity.\n\n12.25pm: Palermo, Italy\n\nIlaria Messina, 22, bartender\n\nIlaria Messina, a bartender in Palermo. Photograph: Lorenzo Tondo/The Guardian\n\nThe truth is that this Thursday, like the other days since this heatwave started, once I arrive at the bar I can\u2019t wait for my shift to end. It\u2019s very tough. Being a bartender in Palermo means moving constantly, serving dozens of espresso and cappuccino at the tables, under the sun. I arrived at work this morning at 8am and will finish my shift at 4pm. Then I have to walk for 20 minutes under the scorching afternoon sun to get home.\n\nWomen walk near Mondello beach during a heatwave in Palermo. Photograph: Igor Petyx/EPA\n\nTry to imagine: twenty minutes under this sun, in this heat, with over 43 degrees. When I open the door of my apartment I\u2019m totally devastated. The only relief is the AC and a fan. There is no other alternative against this heat. This is a different heat compared to the other summers. It\u2019s something different. It\u2019s a stifling heat, but also humid. When we are at work, we drink several litres of water and fruit drinks.\n\nThe world is changing. This heatwave can only be the result of the climate crisis. I\u2019ve been doing this job for several years and I can tell you that every year, every summer, it gets harder and harder. And you think that because we are in Palermo at least we can enjoy the water. No, I can no longer enjoy the sea. It\u2019s too hot there too.\n\n4pm: Phoenix, Arizona\n\nAsh Ponder, photographer\n\nIt is about 119F (48C). I am refuelling gas so I have to be standing outside. It is so intensely terrible. I am in the shade but when I am in the sun I can feel the water sublimating out of my skin.\n\nI had to file early so I got up at 4am. I didn\u2019t have to make photos this morning so I was able to work on my computer. I thought about going to exercise but it was too hot.\n\nI went out at about 10am. Then it wasn\u2019t that bad \u2013 probably about 105F or so. Right now it is almost 120F and it feels miserable. Anytime you open the door you are immediately blasted with a gust of furnace air, it feels so intense. After that though, it is a low-grade constant cooking feeling.\n\nI drink a lot of water \u2013 2 litres \u2013 before I leave the house and take some electrolyte powder mixed in with a little more water just to try to keep electrolyte levels going stable. I will be out probably until sundown.\n\nThe temperature of 115 degrees is displayed on a digital billboard in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. Photograph: Rob Schumacher/USA TODAY NETWORK/Reuters\n\nI am a little nervous because I have to do some hiking as part of this afternoon\u2019s assignment and I know that injuries happen during hiking when you are feeling tired.

Dame Alison Rose has admitted she was the source of a BBC story into Nigel Farage\u2019s finances, for which the Corporation apologised last night. Rose says: \u201cI recognise that in my conversations with Simon Jack of the BBC, I made a serious error of judgment in discussing Mr Farage\u2019s relationship with the bank. \u201cGiven the consequences of this, I want to address the questions that have been raised and set out the substance of the conversations that took place. \u201cBelieving it was public knowledge, I confirmed that Mr Farage was a Coutts customer and that he had been offered a NatWest bank account. Alongside this, I repeated what Mr Farage had already stated, that the bank saw this as a commercial decision. \u201cI would like to emphasise that in responding to Mr Jack\u2019s questions I did not reveal any personal financial information about Mr Farage. \u201cIn response to a general question about eligibility criteria required to bank with Coutts and NatWest I said that guidance on both was publicly available on their websites. In doing so, I recognise that I left Mr Jack with the impression that the decision to close Mr Farage\u2019s accounts was solely a commercial one.\u201d The statement comes a day after the BBC apologised to Farage for reporting that Coutts had closed his account because he was no longer sufficiently wealthy to hold one.

In a statement released early on Wednesday morning, NatWest\u2019s board announced that Rose has agreed by mutual consent to step down as Group Chief Executive with immediate effect. NatWest Group chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said: \u201cThe board and Alison Rose have agreed, by mutual consent, that she will step down as CEO of the NatWest Group. It is a sad moment. \u201cShe has dedicated all her working life so far to NatWest and will leave many colleagues who respect and admire her.\u201d Paul Thwaite, chief executive of the bank\u2019s commercial and institutional business, will take over for 12 months while NatWest seeks a permanent replacement. Rose, who has run NatWest since 2019, said: \u201cI remain immensely proud of the progress the bank has made in supporting people, families and business across the UK, and building the foundations for sustainable growth. My NatWest colleagues are central to that success, and so I would like to personally thank them for all that they have done.\u201d Rose\u2019s resignation comes just a few hours after she admitted being the source of the controversial BBC story that said Farage had lost his Coutts account for commercial reasons, for which she apologised last night (see here). It follows an emergency board meeting last night to determine her future, after NatWest had said Rose still had their full support. Here\u2019s our news story on Rose\u2019s departure: NatWest boss Alison Rose resigns over Nigel Farage Coutts account row Read more\n\n\n\n25 Jul 2023 15.45 EDT Farage\u2019s call was echoed by Tory former cabinet minister David Davis, who said Dame Alison Rose had \u201clittle choice but to resign\u201d. Davis told GB News that a bank clerk or local bank manager who discussed their accounts with a journalist would be summarily dismissed. Responsibilities get larger, not smaller, as you move up an organisation, Davis argues. [Reminder: Rose says she did not reveal any personal financial information about Mr Farage, but did confirm he was a Coutts customer to the BBC\u2019s Simon Jack]. Davis says he\u2019s \u2018astonished\u2019 that the board of NatWest have said they have full confidence in her. He adds: Frankly, if the head of a bank that I was a big shareholder of did this, I would say immediately \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s over, find your successor.\u201d\n\n\n\n25 Jul 2023 15.15 EDT Farage: NatWest management should all go. Farage concludes by urges the government, which owns 39% of NatWest\u2019s shares, to say it has no confidence in the bank\u2019s management when it releases its results on Friday morning. Frankly, I think they should all go.\n\n\n\n25 Jul 2023 15.14 EDT Farage: Someone is lying here Nigel Farage goes on to accuse Dame Alison Rose of breaking \u201can essential confidence\u201d through her conversation with the BBC\u2019s Simon Jack about Farage\u2019s bank account. And he questions the argument that the BBC\u2019s Simon Jack had been left under a misapprehension that the decision to close Farage\u2019s accounts was solely a commercial one. Farage points out that the BBC told him yesterday they had gone back to their NatWest source to check they were happy for the BBc to report that his accounts had been closed for commercial reasons. Farage tells GB News: There is absolutely no way, if the BBC went back for a second time to confirm the story, that they would not have checked that it was the balance of my account that had led to that commercial decision. Someone is lying here. Of that I have no doubt at all. He then cites the UK\u2019s \u2018conduct rules\u2019 setting minimum behaviour standards in financial services, including acting with integrity, with due skill and diligence, and treating customers fairly. Farage says: I think on all of those counts, there has been complete failure in this regard. He concludes that the CEO of Coutts, Peter Flavel, \u201chas not done his job\u201d, saying: It is perfectly clear to me that Alison Rose is unfit to be the CEO of a big group. Chair Howard Davies, who is in charge of governance, has \u201cfailed as well\u201d, Farage adds.

After reading out both statements (which are published earlier in this blog), Farage says that \u201cthe silence had been deafening\u201d until this evening, but that NatWest clearly \u201chad to say something\u201d ahead of its financial results due at 7am on Friday. Farage adds that we have now learned that Rose was the source of Simon Jack\u2019s report that the former Ukip leader had lost his Coutts account because he was no longer sufficiently wealthy to hold one. Farage says Rose has written him a personal letter, in which she \u201cgives me personally her unreserved apology\u201d. He says Rose\u2019s point, that it was Coutts\u2019s decision to \u201cexit\u201d him, points to the CEO of Coutts, Peter Flavel. His voice rising, Farage declares: A man that I have now written to three times. Three times! I\u2019ve not even had an acknowledgement of the receipt of the letters, though I know he\u2019s received them because he\u2019s got other people to ring me as a result of the letters. Farage says he has told Flavel that if he can\u2019t find a new bank account soon, he\u2019ll be turning up with a Securicor van to collect the balance of his account in cash. But despite this prospect, \u201cnothing from him at all\u201d, Farage adds.\n\nUpdated at 14.30 EDT\n\n25 Jul 2023 13.45 EDT Sky News\u2019s Paul Kelso tweets: NatWest CEO Alison Rose acknowledges \u201cserious error of judgment\u201d in discussing Nigel Farage\u2019s banking arrangements with BBC journalist.

Someone is lying here. My full verdict and response at 7pm on @GBNEWS. \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) July 25, 2023\n\n\n\n25 Jul 2023 13.36 EDT FCA raises concerns with NatWest and Coutts Britain\u2019s City watchdog has weighed in, welcoming NatWest\u2019s plan to review exactly what happened. Sheldon Mills, Financial Conduct Authority executive director, consumers and competition, said: \u201cWe have raised concerns with NatWest Group and Coutts about the allegations relating to account closures and breach of customer confidentiality since these came to light. \u201cWe made clear our expectation that these issues should be independently reviewed and note today\u2019s statement from the NatWest Group Board confirming this will happen. \u201cIt is vital that the review is well resourced and those conducting it have access to all the necessary information and people in order to investigate what happened swiftly and fully. \u201cOn the basis of the review and any steps taken by other authorities, such as the Financial Ombudsman Service or Information Commissioner, on relevant complaints, we will decide if any further action is necessary.\u201d\n\n\n\n25 Jul 2023 13.26 EDT Rose says sorry to board and colleagues Alison Rose has also insisted tonight that she was not part \u201cof the decision-making process to exit Mr Farage\u201d. In her statement this evening, the NatWest CEO says: This decision was made by Coutts, and I was informed in April that this was for commercial reasons. \u201cAt the time of my conversations with Mr Jack, I was not in receipt of the contents of the Coutts Wealth Reputational Risk Committee materials subsequently released by Mr Farage. \u201cI have apologised to Mr Farage for the deeply inappropriate language contained in those papers and the board has commissioned a full independent review into the decision and process to ensure that this cannot happen again. \u201cPut simply, I was wrong to respond to any question raised by the BBC about this case. I want to extend my sincere apologies to Mr Farage for the personal hurt this has caused him and I have written to him today. \u201cI would like to say sorry to the board and my colleagues. I started my career working for National Westminster Bank. \u201cIt is an institution I care about enormously and have always been proud to be a part of. It has been the privilege of my career to lead the bank and I am grateful to the board for entrusting me with this role. It is therefore all the more regrettable that my actions have compounded an already difficult issue for the group.\u201d\n\n\n\n25 Jul 2023 13.24 EDT NatWest retains full confidence in Rose, but pay may take a hit The Board of NatWest say they retain full confidence in Alison Rose. That\u2019s despite her admission tonight that she made a \u201cserious error of judgement\u201d in discussing Nigel Farage\u2019s relationship with the bank. However, they also hint that Rose\u2019s pay may be curbed as a result of the row. Howard Davies, chairman of NatWest Group, says it is in the interest of the bank\u2019s shareholders and customers that Rose stays on. Davies says: The Board has noted Alison Rose\u2019s statement on the circumstances of her conversation with Simon Jack and her further apology to Mr Farage As she recognises, she should not have spoken in the way she did. This was a regrettable error of judgement on her part. The events will be taken into account in decisions on remuneration at the appropriate time. However, after careful reflection the Board has concluded that it retains full confidence in Ms Rose as CEO of the bank. She has proved, over the last 4 years to be an outstanding leader of the institution, as demonstrated by our results. The Board therefore believes it is clearly in the interest of all the bank\u2019s shareholders and customers that she continues in post. The Board is clear that the overall handling of the circumstances surrounding Mr Farage accounts has been unsatisfactory, with serious consequences for the bank. The Board will commission an independent review into the account closure arrangement at Coutts, and the lessons to be learnt from this. The findings of that review will be made public on completion. The Terms of Reference and lead firm will be announced shortly.\n\nUpdated at 14.14 EDT\n\n25 Jul 2023 13.15 EDT NatWest boss admits \"serious error of judgement\" in Farage bank closure row Breaking news: The boss of NatWest has admitted a \u201cserious error of judgement\u201d in discussing Nigel Farage\u2019s relationship with the bank.

            "text": "As a child growing up in Egypt, I learned that politics could put you in jail, if not simply get you vanished away. I learned this early on from the way my parents, their friends and our relatives distinguished what could or couldn\u2019t be said. If we broached a subject that was out of bounds, we were brought to silence by stern eye contact from an elder. Rumours were rife about what happened to a classmate\u2019s father; we heard snippets of things but knew we could never ask outright. There were subjects never to be addressed.\n\nThings didn\u2019t change much, even as Egypt became more open in the early 2000s with the arrival of the internet and widespread access to mobile phones. The government had so successfully indoctrinated citizens \u2013 partly through patronage, partly through fear \u2013 that few dared to speak out, even if asked to. As a journalist working in the country from the age of 18, I was quick to learn the red lines, as we referred to them \u2013 the clear parameters of what could or could not be broached. Red lines were considered, tiptoed toward and never crossed. But the Egyptian revolution of 2011 changed this in fundamental ways.\n\nIt was a surprise to everyone that the revolution unfurled with the speed and impact that it did, even though there were indications throughout 2010 that something in the political landscape and imagination was shifting \u2013 the result of a confluence of predicaments and events. In the span of six months, between the summer and winter of 2010, power cuts had become daily occurrences and the prices of basic commodities rocketed. Grievances were high. People felt pressured by the inconvenience and economic difficulties of managing the basic needs of their everyday lives.\n\nAdding to the backdrop of all this were protests raging in nearby Tunisia, which Egyptians watched closely via satellite television. The atmosphere in my home city of Cairo, and across many of the country\u2019s 27 other governorates, was tense. You could feel it in the air.\n\nIn January 2011, Egyptians took to the streets of the capital in their tens of thousands, and in cities and towns across the country. I was part of the protest movement from early on the morning of 25 January, when there were just several hundred of us marching in different groups through the city\u2019s streets. But by late that afternoon, numbers had swelled and approximately 30,000 protesters had gathered in Tahrir (Liberation) Square, in central Cairo, in a standoff with riot police that went on for hours. By the time I left the square, well after midnight, the crowds were still there, with no signs of leaving \u2013 neither the putrid teargas that filled the air nor the rubber bullets that were being fired at protesters by the police had any effect. The protesters were steadfast.\n\nThree days later, more than 1 million people joined a march through Cairo and towards Tahrir Square. From that point on, the numbers multiplied by the day. Egyptians demonstrated in the streets of the capital and through cities, towns and villages across the country, camping out in public squares in makeshift tents and temporary constructions. They marched with banners calling for reforms and basic rights; they used pots and pans for percussion; they chanted mantras such as the most popular refrain: \u201cbread, freedom, social justice\u201d. And they broke into song.\n\nIn the months that followed, the popular social, political and economic expression that had found an outlet in the streets in the form of banners and chants extended into the mainstream narrative through articles, websites, magazines and books.\n\nPolitical parties were formed in unprecedented numbers. Manifestos seemed to be everywhere \u2013 stuck on lampposts, handed out in public squares and circulated online. Criticism of the government, the president, the ministers and even the long-sacred army became commonplace. Public protest against the government became the go-to means of complaint.\n\nIts form became the marching body, and its message was conveyed in the chants and songs that accompanied it.\n\nFor anyone who participated in the 18 days of protests in 2011 that led to the ousting of Hosni Mubarak, the early days of the revolution, when people camped out in Tahrir Square, had the feeling of a festive event, somewhat like a concert. Ramy Essam, then in his early 20s, was one of the singers who brought music to the heart of the revolution. During the height of the uprising, Essam performed in front of the hundreds of thousands of Egyptians gathered in and around the square. He got up on a small platform set up for political manifestos, brought out his classical guitar and started to sing political rock. Slowly he commanded the attention of all those in the square who could hear him. Word spread and the crowds around him grew. He would scribble down his lyrics at night in the tent he shared with friends.\n\nHis song Irhal (Leave) became an anthem to the revolution: \u201cWe\u2019re all one hand and we have one demand / Leave leave leave down / Down with Hosni Mubarak! The people demand / The fall of the regime / He will leave / We won\u2019t leave / We\u2019re all one hand and we have one demand / Leave leave leave.\u201d\n\nProtesters in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square in February 2011. Photograph: Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters\n\nEssam became one of the musical voices of the uprising, and when Mubarak finally stepped down on 11 February 2011, the song Sawt al-Hurriya (The Sound of Freedom) was played on every TV, radio and satellite channel.\n\nBut Essam wasn\u2019t the only one. Along with colleagues at a small magazine we edited, Bidoun, I was led to two rappers, Sadat and Amr Haha, performing in a corner of Tahrir Square, riffing on the streets about the revolution and what the people wanted \u2013 essentially, why they were there (\u201cin search of a better life\u201d). Sadat was just 18. To get to Tahrir Square he took several buses from the housing project where he lived, which had been built to house the refugees of the 1992 Cairo earthquake.\n\nWe had no sense at the time that this emerging genre would become so popular. But these young men, who had next to nothing, wove words and phrases with beats so brilliantly that they stuck in your head. Like other rappers, Sadat and his crew also sang about drugs and women, but their main theme was the lack of cash and its related problems, such as not having the means to start a family. These were the types of things one was hearing young people speak about in Tahrir Square, too. The majority of them weren\u2019t really there for the downfall of a dictator \u2013 they were there because of the lack of basic needs.\n\nAs the revolution began to falter, Sadat also rapped about the return to the status quo. His lyrics tackled police brutality, political assassinations, corruption and the chaos of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s rule. He called it \u201cthe abyss\u201d, \u201call in the name of religion\u201d. He didn\u2019t stop there, but took on the military next. Sadat became as beloved by millions of fans as he was despised by the regime itself. He had followed in the footsteps of Ramy Essam, as much revered by the people as he was despised by the state.\n\nThe events of 2011 had been the impetus for millions of Egyptians to buy smartphones, making internet access widespread in a much more immediate way via 3G. Within months of Mubarak stepping down, the number of Egyptians with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and SoundCloud accounts rocketed. Young writers, artists and musicians were putting out their work on social media. \u201cThere was an incredible sense of freedom,\u201d said Sadat. \u201cEverything was changing. It was liberating.\u201d\n\nThe frank, hip-hop-inspired music form adopted by Sadat and his peers was growing in popularity. More artists were dabbling in it, and its young audience was growing. It would come to be known as mahraganat, from the word mahragan, meaning festival. Young people were recognising themselves in the lyrics, and felt they were being heard. This music was spreading, but was still kept out of the mainstream because of its \u201cvulgarity\u201d and the ill ease it instilled.\n\nThose of us who partook in the \u201crevolution\u201d or \u201cuprising\u201d never expected the sense of agency to end. But it disintegrated when the army formally came to power after the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi in the summer of 2013 and the contrived election the following spring of then-defence minister and army general Abdel Fatah El-Sisi.\n\nMuslim Brotherhood members were rounded up in their hundreds and thrown in prison. Politically active citizens were arrested and put through swift trials in military court, without lawyers, and most of them were thrown in jail. A judge sentenced 683 alleged Muslim Brotherhood members to death in a single trial. Gatherings of 10 people or more were outlawed. Police began to stop young people in the streets and search their phones. This had never happened before.\n\nUnder Sisi, the red lines of censorship have expanded beyond political discourse to include anything from lurid song lyrics to social media posts that are deemed \u201cmorally offensive\u201d.\n\nAs I write this, at least six young women are in jail for appearing in videos said to be in violation of \u201cfamily principles and values upheld by Egyptian society\u201d \u2013 one clip involves a divorcee in tight-fitting clothes dancing with her boyfriend. Such arrests are not a matter of state policy per se, but the Stasi-like practice of \u201ccitizen patrolling\u201d \u2013 of spying, monitoring and reporting against fellow citizens. This policing system has discouraged anything potentially disruptive to the state, including content posted by local social-media influencers.\n\nThe content is perhaps less the offence than is the number of viewers who see it. Under a law passed in 2018, social media users with more than 5,000 followers are considered \u201cmedia outlets\u201d, making them subject to prosecution for publishing anything considered \u201cfalse news\u201d or \u201cincitement\u201d \u2013 umbrella terms that can be twisted to include almost all personal expression. In a state that has deemed itself perennially at threat, there are also no clear-cut criteria \u2013 the only constant is that parameters are continually shifting. Who is reported, prosecuted, arrested, released \u2013 all this is arbitrary.\n\nWithin this political climate, it is telling that Egypt\u2019s independent music scene \u2013 and particularly Arabic hip-hop, or mahraganat \u2013 has been thriving. Borrowing from US artists such as Snoop Dogg, Tupac, Eminem and Jay-Z, and from the earlier history of hip-hop, these Egyptian artists write lyrics that are grounded in deeply personal, political, sexual and socioeconomic realities \u2013 everything the government would prefer citizens not to speak about, and the kind of material that citizen patrols love to report.\n\nThe artists rap about their own lives, their neighbourhoods, their rivals, and their personal, economic and political battles, as well as their successes, money, women, dreams. In one song, for example, the duo Oka and Ortega rhapsodise about drinking alcohol and taking drugs \u2013 both considered blasphemy in Islam, and the drugs, needless to say, punishable with jail: \u201cYou\u2019re sitting alone, idle-minded / Satan is leading you to the wrong path / He keeps telling you \u2018Let\u2019s play, dude\u2019 / Let\u2019s play, dude, why don\u2019t you play / Dude, let\u2019s play, dude, let\u2019s play / Dude / You want to be a man of principle / Quit the drugs / And say \u2018I\u2019m starting\u2019 / Satan comes and keeps telling you / Drink, dude, drink, dude, light it, dude.\u201d\n\nFans of the rapper Sadat at a show in 2013. Photograph: Mosa\u2019ab Elshamy\n\nA growing league of local artists, most in their 20s, boasts millions of followers online. They have sold out concerts at licensed venues, but also at street weddings and private parties, even as the state has repeatedly attempted to shut them down. Many of these artists were too young to properly partake in the Egyptian revolution \u2013 most were in their early teens or younger \u2013 but they came of age at that moment of rupture when everyone was speaking out. It has, over time, come to define who they are, too \u2013 outspoken, uninhibited, independent, free.\n\nUnlike my generation, which came of age in the 90s and was raised in constant fear of speech, the rules of the game for these musicians don\u2019t follow any of the old social or cultural norms. They rap about long-taboo issues.\n\nThese singers commanded my attention, and even my envy at first, precisely for their lack of inhibition \u2013 for their fierce assertion of independent, nonconformist identities. They are free in an environment that does everything it can to break individual freedoms. They did not cave in, as my generation did.\n\nAbout 60% of Egypt\u2019s population, or 65 million people, are under the age of 29, so it is no surprise that these young musicians have millions of fans at their command. It is those fans, influenced by the artists they revere, who are the future of the country \u2013 and who will essentially define what Egypt comes to be.\n\nMarwan Pablo is among Egypt\u2019s most popular and successful young rappers. He was young when the revolution erupted, but old enough to know what it promised for the lives of people like him. For the 18 days that Egyptians had been camped out in squares across the country, it was clear that most of the youth were there for the promise of better lives, better homes, better neighbourhoods.\n\nThese promises had essentially dissipated by 2015, when the government\u2019s witch hunt against the Islamists reached its peak. Between 2013 and 2015, in neighbourhoods across Alexandria, where Pablo is from, as well as in other governorates, masked special forces stormed buildings, kicked down apartment doors, dragged out men and, on occasion, women, and took them away. Crackdowns were violent and extreme, and these incidents were rampant.\n\nIt was not easy to be a young man at that time, and certainly not one from the working class or from a conservative neighbourhood.\n\nThe threat of being persecuted by the state was constant, and decent jobs were hard to come by. Pablo, in his mid-20s, worked several jobs, enough to make a basic living. In 2018 he released a song, Sindbad, that expressed how hard it was for someone like him to beat the system and make a future: \u201cA year that smells like money / Smells like alcohol, smells like lessons / It went fine, I\u2019m not in jail / Thank God.\u201d\n\nEgyptian rapper Marwan Pablo. Photograph: Marwan Pablo\n\nThe success of Sindbad brought Pablo gigs. Everyone could understand his plain language and his talk of money. But the song was also highly political, even as it steered clear of direct political commentary. Sindbad had echoes of Jay-Z rapping as a Black man subjected to racism, but in Egypt Pablo was rapping about class. The government\u2019s repressive security apparatus had always persecuted young, poor men, framing them, using them as scapegoats and simply keeping the population fearful by being ruthless as a matter of messaging and policy. Sindbad, the character in the song, was rising above the circumstances that plagued young men like himself to buy himself freedom. The leading Cairo mahraganat producers took an interest. A series of songs followed, in addition to an appearance in an Arabic documentary on the genre. Pablo\u2019s collaborations with the Cairo-based producer Molotof (after the molotov cocktails that were used by young protesters during the 2011 revolution) heralded his rise in the charts.\n\nPablo\u2019s most popular track, Free, became something of an anthem for the freeing of the mind through a state-of-consciousness that can only come under the influence of drugs (\u201cIf you go crazy then you are free / We drive the world to Mars / We drive the world with no benzene / If you go crazy then you are free\u201d), and it was beginning to be streamed millions of times online. Young people driving tok-toks (three-wheeled taxis) started playing Pablo\u2019s song from thumb drives, which was the ultimate measure of fame. The song was a breakthrough in terms of reach, and the government took note.\n\nThe video for the song was shot in Alexandria. It features atmospheric cinematography of the city: Pablo in a car, at a graveyard, on the corniche, smoking, singing, dancing and drinking. Together with Molotof, they roam the city that nurtured the creativity that set him \u201cfree\u201d. Pablo critiques the country\u2019s suffocating circumstances and touts the liberation that comes with mind-altering substances.\n\nSongs such as Free made Pablo one of the most popular rap artists across Alexandria and Cairo. He had no fear of what people might think, of cultural taboos or of how the ultra-conservative and religiously inclined government and community around him might respond. But as his listener numbers climbed, giving mahraganat a broader reach, people began to talk about cultural values changing. Something was shifting.\n\nWhen I set out to write about the mahraganat scene several years ago, I believed that the music was spawning a movement that would generate political change. It seemed like a vast and important shift \u2013 this young generation of artists who were speaking about realities and opinions that preceding generations had been too fearful to explore publicly. Here, finally, was a sizable segment of the population being vocal about relationships, drugs, alcohol \u2013 issues that were never previously deemed appropriate for general conversation.\n\nWhat was even more striking was their willingness to talk about the political realities suffered by tens of millions of Egyptians \u2013 the economic hardships, inequalities and the extreme control of public opinion and debate. It was a massive break from the past. It seemed like the core ingredient for change would be what was conceived in Tahrir Square: the ability to discuss problems openly, publicly, with resonance. Only then could a public consensus be gained and solutions collectively reached. Music seemed like a solid starting point.\n\nThat hope has been complicated in part due to the rule of Sisi, who has constructed a parallel system to the government that is commanded by the army and steeped in censorship and control. Although the music scene has been somewhat uncontrollable, with its reliance on international platforms like YouTube, SoundCloud and Spotify, every other means of public debate and expression has been quashed. The hope for a pluralistic political system was given up on long ago \u2013 when the president ran for re-election, every potential opposition candidate was threatened, arrested or otherwise intimidated by the state. Opposition, which is a prerequisite for a healthy political environment, has been all but shut down. Public consensus no longer matters to the government. (In a recent interview, Sisi said that \u201cthe country is being rebuilt and the stories of individuals can\u2019t factor into that equation\u201d.)\n\nMore and more, the situation feels like a political timebomb. As Sisi pours billions of dollars into megaprojects that line the pockets of his entourage and their business allies, the country is facing its most severe economic crisis in decades: debt is at a record high and inflation has soared. The extreme wealth of a new class of multimillionaire generals and their families is being rubbed in the face of a vast youth population that has no means and no real chances of making a living. Good jobs are hard to come by; wages are generally low.\n\nRamy Essam performing in Tahrir Square in 2011. Photograph: Alaa Kamhawi\n\nThe only thing these young people do seem to have and hold on to as a symbol of hope is those music stars, whose footsteps they want to follow in. But sometimes the music itself seems to stir up further anger and frustration \u2013 these sentiments and energies are very tangibly simmering among some fans and artists.\n\nIn the last few years, before and then after Covid, I found myself becoming increasingly uncomfortable around some of these groups. But I came to realise that for the majority of young people, the music is unleashing energy that has been pent up inside them as a result of unmet material wants, and a sense of futility in imagining a tomorrow that is any different from their current situation. \u201cLife is about today,\u201d one fan in a group of young men told me, his friends nodding in agreement beside him. \u201cI\u2019m 22 and there is no future, so let me do what I want today.\u201d That translates into roaming the streets, listening to music, sometimes breaking things. \u201cI throw bottles [at buildings] because it feels good,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a release.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the Egyptian academic year that began in October 2022, the government issued a blanket ban of mahraganat music as well as weapons and \u201ctight\u201d clothing on university campuses nationwide. The rules covered anything \u201cinappropriate\u201d: too tight, ripped, distressed or see-through, along with shorts, flip-flops and leggings. Traditional galabiyas (robes) were also banned. \u201cWeapons\u201d included fireworks and flares alongside knives and guns. A note against eating, smoking or drinking in lecture halls was also included in the statement, and although it was not directly stated, this was assumed to mean alcohol. The country\u2019s most widely watched television hosts all took up the issue on their nightly segments, debating the necessity for this kind of control, but also asking aloud what had happened to our society: \u201cThe values of our society are broken\u201d was the most frequent refrain.\n\nAs Egypt negotiated a new bailout package from the IMF last autumn, which involved a proper float of the currency, which has historically been pegged to the dollar, prices increased again. In the course of two days, the Egyptian pound lost 35% of its value. Headlines spoke of shortages of rice, chicken, eggs \u2013 not because they weren\u2019t actually available, but because traders were hoarding supplies in order to release them later at higher prices. People began to murmur about \u201cbread riots\u201d and what the revolution of hunger might look like.\n\nThe 10th anniversary of the revolution in 2021 was marked by a political climate of censorship and human rights abuses. Although official figures are hard to come by, it was estimated by human rights groups that up to 60,000 political dissidents were being held in jail as of late 2022, many for belonging to the wrong political party.\n\nI believe it is fair to say that Egypt is now at the most oppressive point in its modern history. Government and army officials have often been quoted saying that the longstanding \u201cemergency rule\u201d measures have been necessary to avoid the kind of chaos seen in Syria or the political mayhem experienced under the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s rule. Sisi has explicitly stated on television that he will never allow what occurred in 2011 to happen again. People I know are in prison simply for voicing opinions or personal experiences. One friend, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a blogger, computer programmer and activist, was arrested in 2019 for a Facebook post and has been in prison ever since on fabricated charges of spreading false news that undermined national security. Freedom of speech is a calculated risk you choose to take.\n\nYet despite this repressive atmosphere and the constant threat of censorship and silencing, a generation has broken through the fear barrier of personal and political expression. What happened in the 18 months between January 2011 and July 2013 \u2013 the street protests that led to the downfall of Mubarak and his clan, and the subsequent ones in 2013 that led to the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi \u2013 can never entirely be reversed.\n\nThis is an edited extract from Laughter in the Dark: Egypt to the Tune of Change, published by Columbia Global Reports",

            "text": "This is not a Hollywood story: it\u2019s a Belgian story, for a start. It\u2019s not even certain to end well; that\u2019s a bit up in the air right now. But it\u2019s a story about how things \u2013 important things \u2013 could be different. How they could, perhaps, be better. It\u2019s a story about Li\u00e8ge, a city whose 19th-century heyday as a coal and steel powerhouse is long gone. Like many ex-coal and steel towns, Li\u00e8ge is poor, with increasing numbers of households living in poverty, but it also has a strong solidarity culture, a diverse population \u2013 and the best waffles.\n\nSo far, so Belgian. But why are we talking about Li\u00e8ge? Because in 2013, a group of activists who wanted to make food and city life better, greener and fairer, brought 600 people \u2013 all with an interest in food production \u2013 together. It asked them to imagine what could be different in Li\u00e8ge, within one generation. It\u2019s an interesting question, the fundamental one really: what change can we concretely effect within our lifetimes? What they arrived at was this: \u201cThat in 35 years, one generation, the majority of food consumed in the Li\u00e8ge region would be grown locally in the best ecological and social conditions.\u201d That\u2019s a nice, if wordy, aspiration. But the thing is, they\u2019ve tried to make it happen and even \u2013 to a degree \u2013 have succeeded.\n\nThat moment spawned a movement that is now coordinated by a non-profit called the Li\u00e8ge Food Belt: six employees, funded by a hand-to-mouth combination of local, regional and European money.\n\n\u201cPeople say it\u2019s a revolution,\u201d says Christian Jonet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a revolution yet, but it has the potential: we\u2019re at the start of the story.\u201d Along with his colleague, Elisabeth Gruie, this energetic, but exhausted-looking man is generously squeezing my visit into his packed calendar. Gruie used to be a banker and Jonet\u2019s story is similarly unexpected: he spent eight years selling aeroplane engine repairs, gradually, he says, becoming aware \u201cthat I was taking part in the problem, not the solution\u201d. Increasingly conscious of the challenges presented by the climate crisis, he started to get involved in sustainability initiatives as a volunteer, rapidly realising food was one of the crucial challenges for the new millennium. Today he\u2019s the coordinator for the Food Belt.\n\nGreen guru: Elisabeth Gruie works for the Belt Aliment-Terre Li\u00e8ge (CATL). Photograph: HJ Hunter/The Observer\n\nUnder the Food Belt umbrella, there are 28 food co-ops and about 300 individual producers. Those co-ops include retailers, a brewery, bakeries and a vineyard. The shops are supplied by a range of hyper-local producers.\n\nThere\u2019s the weekly Court-Circuit market in the city centre, which sells the network\u2019s produce. The Food Belt also holds a 10-day annual food festival, Nourrir Li\u00e8ge, which has spawned emulators in Brussels, Strasbourg and soon Qu\u00e9bec. There\u2019s a newly opened House of Sustainable Food that tries to touch the parts of the population that sustainable, organic food initiatives often miss, with cookery classes, nature walks and communal meals.\n\nBut the most impressive part might be the schools. The Food Belt worked for several years with schools and cr\u00e8ches to help source food sustainably. Since 2021, about 100 schools are now under a new regime: meat, bread, dairy and fruit are organic, local and, as far as possible, from within the Food Belt network. The city is aiming for 100% organic and local by 2024.\n\nThen there\u2019s the breaktime soup initiative. Thanks to the Food Belt, 5,000 pupils in local schools in vulnerable socioeconomic areas have been getting free, organic, locally produced soup for a morning snack. That\u2019s already a dramatic social good, but the soup is also made by a small non-profit, Echafaudage, that assists the long-term unemployed back into work, then it\u2019s delivered by the Food Belt co-op Rayon9 using cargo bikes. It\u2019s been so successful that the region, which financed the project, has increased its budget fivefold.\n\nIt all sounds idyllic, extraordinary, a revolution. Rob Hopkins, sustainability pioneer and co-founder of the Transition Network, agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unique really. It\u2019s by far the most ambitious project like it. They\u2019ve pulled it together with a brilliant can-do spirit.\u201d\n\nDish of the day: long-term unemployed volunteers serve a local produced organic soup to children. They participate in a pilot project for schools in vulnerable communities. Photograph: HJ Hunter/The Observer\n\nBut what does that look and feel like on the ground? I went to find out and, over two days, I see what it takes to coordinate better ways of feeding a city: networking, sharing ideas, communicating, lobbying, meetings \u2013 lots of meetings. Jonet and Gruie show me around.\n\nWe start in the ordinary-looking suburb of Sainte-Walburge where, in the mud and mist, David Wagemans, a bearded guy in combats and a fleece, is boxing up the last tomatoes for the food co-op shop to collect. This is Les Pousses Poussent, the market garden run on land gifted by the city.\n\nWagemans used to be a chef; he and partner F\u00e9licie took over the plot in 2019. \u201cWe enclosed it, put it to green fertiliser, dug it, put greenhouses in, a fruit hedge, and then we started in April 2020,\u201d he tells me, as I admire the chard and the beans. \u201cWe\u2019ve doubled the surface area. We started with 75 pickers; now we\u2019ve got more than 135.\u201d It\u2019s an inviting place that lures passersby in. As we chat, a couple come and ask how to sign up (there\u2019s a waiting list); another man wanders over to offer Wagemans his excess white raspberry plants.\n\nThere are four staff now, they added bees this year and diversified planting. The plan is, if they can, to take over a neighbouring field, also owned by the city, sign up more pickers, maybe get a ploughing horse and train people to use it. \u201cLittle by little, we\u2019re trying to go further.\u201d For now, though, Wagemans looks cold \u2013 it\u2019s raining \u2013 so I ask him quickly how things are going. \u201cProfitability isn\u2019t wild,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is time and money.\u201d But he\u2019s happy. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go back for anything in the world.\u201d\n\nThose tomatoes are heading for Les Petits Producteurs shops. In the Sainte-Walburge branch Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric \u2013 a proud resident of this area with \u201cmany different cultures\u201d \u2013 shows me around. \u201cIt\u2019s not too expensive and it\u2019s accessible to as many as possible.\u201d It\u2019s also no-frills, the focus is on fresh, local, organic fruit and vegetables, with photos of the producers and an explanation of what they do and where. Beyond the fresh stuff, there are loose grains and flours in crates, and a small range of products on simple shelves. Shop policy is, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric explains, \u201cone need, one product. There\u2019s only one kind of mayonnaise \u2013 we could have had 10, but it\u2019s simpler and it reduces costs.\u201d\n\nService with a smile: Christian Jonet at the biological food market. Photograph: HJ Hunter/The Observer\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from Whole Foods, but that\u2019s the point: this is a co-op and their business model is based on a fair deal for producers. Producers set the price \u2013 no haggling \u2013 and the shops commit to take a certain quantity annually, in advance. There\u2019s total transparency: 70% of the sale price goes to the producers. Talking to shoppers is a big part of the job: persuading, explaining, describing who grew what, or how to prepare celeriac. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where you can meet people; where people take their time.\u201d\n\nPascal Hennen, the mastermind behind Les Petits Producteurs (\u201cbut I\u2019m an employee, just like the others\u201d) arrives on his bike. I ask him how this whole thing started. \u201cI became conscious that supermarkets and mass distribution are really harmful both on a human level and for the farming sector. I tried being a grower, but I wasn\u2019t made for farming, pulling leeks in wet snow. I always had cold hands.\u201d He didn\u2019t like the ethics of the large-scale organic shop where he worked either: \u201cI tried to influence them, but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d Les Petits Producteurs launched in 2017 \u2013 now there are four shops, with 25 employees.\n\nSpared the logistical issues that dogged supermarket distribution, Les Petits Producteurs became a lifeline for locals during Covid. \u201cSometimes we were the only person a customer saw in a day,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. Now, though, pandemic shoppers have gone back to their \u201cbad habits\u201d and the cost-of-living crisis has started to bite in earnest. An ebbing customer base, hard on the heels of excess demand during the pandemic, is creating chaos with that guaranteed volume policy. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether madame will buy potatoes,\u201d Hennen says, gesturing at a browsing customer. \u201cBut I have to \u2018know\u2019 a year in advance.\u201d That\u2019s much harder now. When there\u2019s too much of something, the shop adds an \u201cSOS\u201d label to encourage customers to buy or offers recipe cards; they\u2019re contemplating launching all-in meal packages. Still, times are tough. \u201cWe have customers who tell us, I\u2019m going to have to choose between eating and heating: what should I do?\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric says. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit trapped by economic realities.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a more celebratory atmosphere the next day at the \u201cEU organic shop of the year\u201d, La Ferme \u00e0 L\u2019Arbre. In the orchards, cows and chickens are cohabiting peaceably and inside the vast shop is buzzing following the recently awarded prize. While I\u2019m talking to owner-manager Michel P\u00e2que, he is regularly interrupted by customer congratulations. The ceremony in the EU\u2019s Berlaymont building was a far cry from his daily routine. \u201cYou have to send your ID card, they send you a QR code, then it\u2019s like an airport, you have to take everything off! It\u2019s huge, a labyrinth, you end up in this room with microphones and interpreters\u2026 It was a beautiful experience, though.\u201d\n\nSeeds of hope: David Wagemans of Les Pousses Poussent at the plot for sustainable agriculture. Photograph: HJ Hunter/The Observer\n\nYou can see why they won: this is a hell of a place. There are 40 employees, the vast majority of vegetables are produced on site (they grow 60 varieties), they butcher their own organic beef and pork, those happy hens outside produce the eggs and there\u2019s a cheese counter, deli, bakery and even a restaurant. It\u2019s also the oldest organic farm in the region, founded by P\u00e2que\u2019s father in 1978. The permacrisis is taking its toll here, too, but P\u00e2que is sanguine. \u201cWe tell ourselves what we produce is fair and real and local \u2013 in principle, that should last.\u201d\n\nLa Ferme was threatened with compulsory purchase because a nearby prison needed a new site, but the Li\u00e8ge network sprung into action, lobbying local government, which in turn lobbied the region. Shop and farm are now safe. It is also the birthplace of another Food Belt success story: the Li\u00e8ge Co-operative Brewery. The hops are still grown at La Ferme, but the brewery has a new home, a few minutes\u2019 drive away. When we pop in, Stany Herman is tidying up as the fermenter gurgles. He\u2019s one of a team of six behind the range of four Badjawe beers, Li\u00e8ge dialect for \u201cchatty\u201d. Herman, a former web designer who \u201ctripped\u201d into brewing, is certainly chatty, explaining that the classic blonde is \u201cmore treacherous\u201d (6.5%) than the festive (at 4.5%, a \u201cgood drinking beer\u201d). All their ingredients are \u201chyperlocal\u201d \u2013 their furthest supplier is 32km away \u2013 as is their distribution network. Business is decent \u2013 the co-op has 500 members \u2013 but here, too, the cost-of-living and energy crises are taking their toll. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s worse than during Covid. Maybe because tiredness is setting in, but you have to adapt all the time, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nA food revolution is complicated, and it\u2019s slow. There are setbacks and compromises, but gradually a painstaking knitting together of tiny links to build an alternative system, working out what\u2019s missing and somehow supplying it, can drive change. Hopkins agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s really understated. They\u2019re just quietly building these relationships and connections.\u201d Currently, Li\u00e8ge has lots of \u201csmall things that offer a real alternative\u201d, as Jonet says. That could lead to big things. But can they scale up? And how, especially right now, when the cost-of-living crisis is squeezing the whole network?\n\nWhat we produce is fair, real and local \u2013 in theory, that should last\n\nWe talk about this a lot, Jonet, Gruie and I, in the car. We talk, too, at the Food Belt office in the brand-new \u201clogistics hub\u201d. It\u2019s an impressive spot, where the Food Belt team works and trains entrepreneurs with sustainable food ideas. The plan is for a second building next door to create another of the \u201cmissing links\u201d in their network: a plant to wash, store, prepare and possibly bottle the network\u2019s produce. That would help secure supply over leaner months and ensure school canteens can also get their veg through the network.\n\nThe hub is important because it demonstrates what happens when you can get public authorities involved, a key strategy for scaling up this experiment. They were initially reactive, not proactive. Now, though, the city and region are a potentially powerful catalyst for change (current anxieties around food security and food sovereignty have doubtless helped). Certainly, without them the school projects would not have happened, or the hub, and funding the Food Belt\u2019s continued existence has become easier with official support. That increased public sector buy-in gives Jonet hope for the future: \u201cThose alliances between co-operatives, citizens and public authorities will help us get through this difficult stage. But there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nI have only seen a fraction of the network \u2013 to see it all would take days, weeks even (the Vin de Li\u00e8ge vineyard co-op raising \u20ac2m would make a business school case study all by itself). But the picture is clear \u2013 these are vocations not jobs, and they\u2019re hard work, undertaken with conviction and considerable joy, but in 2023, they are harder than ever. For now, Jonet has another meeting. \u201cI do a lot of networking,\u201d he says, with characteristic understatement. \u201cWe know everyone in the ecosystem. Our job is to connect people, to transmit good ideas; sometimes just talking about an idea in the network can mean someone else takes hold of it and it happens.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly 10 years since the \u201cbig bang\u201d as Jonet calls that ambitious, if rather drily worded, statement of intent. Where are they now? \u201cWe\u2019re always being asked, \u2018So, are you on the right path?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the answer is \u2018no\u2019. I reckon we\u2019re at about 5%.\u201d That\u2019s no Hollywood ending, but I warned you it wouldn\u2019t be: this is real life, this is 2023, this is Li\u00e8ge. \u201cIt feels like this is a make-or-break moment,\u201d Jonet adds later. I really hope they make it. I think they will: a structure you build slowly and carefully, with love and conviction, has a good chance of surviving a storm, surely. But even if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ve shown us what\u2019s possible.",

            "text": "Towards the end of last month, Mar\u00eda Guardiola, who leads the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) in the Extremadura region of south-west Spain, gave a speech in which she tore into the far-right Vox party for its denial of gender-based violence, its demonisation of migrants and its attacks on the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nGuardiola was far from alone in her aversion to Vox\u2019s views and tactics. The party\u2019s most recent stunt in the run-up to Spain\u2019s general election this Sunday \u2013 which could put the far right in government for the first time since the return to democracy after the Franco dictatorship \u2013 had been the unveiling in Madrid of a massive banner showing a giant hand tossing symbols representing feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, Catalan independence, environmental programmes and communism into a bin.\n\nBut what made Guardiola\u2019s stance different was the fact her party had recently cut a deal to rule the Valencia region in coalition with Vox \u2013 and that to have any chance of governing Extremadura after finishing second in May\u2019s regional election, she would have to rely on the party\u2019s support.\n\nGuardiola was having none of it and said she would be prepared to stand in a repeat of the regional elections rather than countenance any deals with Vox, adding that her word was all she had. \u201cI can\u2019t allow those who deny gender-based violence \u2026 those who are dehumanising immigrants and those who unfurl a banner chucking the LGBTI flag into the bin into government,\u201d she insisted.\n\nYet on Monday this week, Guardiola was sworn in as Extremadura\u2019s president after forming a coalition with Vox and deciding that, on reflection, \u201cmy word isn\u2019t as important as the future of the people of Extremadura\u201d.\n\nIt was not the first time that the PP \u2013 which could well form a national coalition government with Vox if, as expected, it falls short of an absolute majority on Sunday \u2013 has tied itself up in knots over its relationship with the far-right party.\n\nIn October 2020, the PP\u2019s then leader, Pablo Casado \u2013 whose party had relied on Vox\u2019s support to prop up three of its regional governments \u2013 finally eviscerated the far-right outfit for being populists who peddled \u201ceasy \u2013 and usually fake \u2013 solutions to complex problems\u201d. Unlike Vox, added Casado, the PP didn\u2019t want to be \u201canother party of fear, of rage, of resentment and revenge, of insults and skirmishes, nor of manipulation, lies and backwards opposition\u201d.\n\nLess than two years later, the PP brushed aside such reservations and formed its first coalition regional government with Vox in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. Given the precedents and the pragmatic nature of Spanish politics, few people on the streets of Guardiola\u2019s home town of C\u00e1ceres were taken aback by her sudden U-turn.\n\n\u201cWhy did Guardiola change her mind?\u201d asked one local man, rhetorically. \u201cBecause the PP told her to.\u201d\n\nThe old town of C\u00e1ceres, in Extremadura, which is the home town of the region\u2019s new president, Mar\u00eda Guardiola. Photograph: Santiago Urquijo/Getty Images\n\nConcha, a self-confessed \u201ctextbook social democrat\u201d who had taken her grandson to a park not far from C\u00e1ceres\u2019s imposing main square, was also far from stunned. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a surprise that Guardiola did the deal \u2013 it was only logical that she\u2019d make a deal, because you don\u2019t want to lose out on governing,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile she wasn\u2019t too bothered by Guardiola\u2019s decision to hand Vox the regional ministry for forest management, hunting and fishing, Concha said the party should not be allowed to influence environmental and farming policy, \u201cbecause of their denial of climate change\u201d.\n\nOthers in Extremadura were more forthright. \u201cThe PP have chucked Guardiola under the bus; they\u2019ve sold her out and they\u2019ve humiliated her,\u201d said Irene de Miguel, the leader of the leftwing Podemos party in the region. \u201cThey\u2019ve made her go back on her word when she came out and said that her word was all she had. So if she doesn\u2019t have her word any more, what does she have? Nothing.\u201d\n\nDe Miguel said that rather than tackling housing, employment, depopulation and the region\u2019s energy economy, the new PP-Vox administration was focusing on culture war issues, such as repealing the Democratic Memory Law and an ideological scrutiny of what children are taught in Extremadura\u2019s schools.\n\nShe also noted the PP\u2019s national leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, had repeatedly insisted that the party that won the largest share of the votes should be allowed to govern. In Extremadura, that party was the Spanish Socialist Workers party (PSOE) of the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\n\n\u201cFeij\u00f3o has been saying again and again that the party that wins the most votes should be allowed to govern. It\u2019s totally contradictory for Guardiola to be invested here with Vox\u2019s votes because she didn\u2019t win the most votes,\u201d De Miguel said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Jaime Reina/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDespite supposedly seeking to reclaim the centre ground since he became the party\u2019s leader last year, Feij\u00f3o and some of his entourage have shown themselves more than willing to cut deals with Vox and to use the kind of tactics more beloved of populist leaders than self-proclaimed moderates.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Spain\u2019s state broadcaster, RTVE, Feij\u00f3o refused to accept his claims about his party\u2019s record on pension levels were incorrect and instead asked the journalist, Silvia Intxaurrondo, to apologise and to issue a correction to her claims. But Intxaurrondo\u2019s statements were borne out by the facts and Feij\u00f3o eventually conceded that there had been \u201cinaccuracies\u201d in his claims.\n\nHowever, one of Feij\u00f3o\u2019s key allies, the MEP Esteban Gonz\u00e1lez Pons, accused RTVE of backing S\u00e1nchez\u2019s PSOE and called on its directors to resign if the PP won the election. His words were swiftly condemned by Spain\u2019s main press association.\n\nLast week Feij\u00f3o also appeared to cast doubt on the impartiality of Spain\u2019s postal service when he called on postal workers \u201cto deliver all the votes, independently of their bosses\u201d. Postal votes have taken on a new importance in this election as many Spaniards will be on holiday for the snap summer poll.\n\nJos\u00e9 Pablo Ferr\u00e1ndiz, the head of public opinion and political research at Ipsos Spain, said that while the polls remained relatively close, the right had a highly motivated electorate on its side.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing a hyper-mobilised right for a long time now and a left that was very demobilised according to the polls, but which we thought would reactivate as the election approached,\u201d he said. \u201cDemobilisation affects the left much more than the right \u2013 especially voters on the centre left. I think it\u2019s going to be very hard for the left to mobilise those voters in the time left, so the right is pretty much guaranteed to win, irrespective of whether it gets an absolute majority or not.\u201d\n\nFerr\u00e1ndiz said centre-right voters who might once have been put off voting for the PP because of its alliances with Vox would probably vote for the PP because such pacts had become normalised \u2013 and because the alternative would be a PSOE coalition with the far-left Sumar alliance, perhaps propped up by the votes of Basque and Catalan pro-independence parties.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they may not like the deals with Vox, but it\u2019s the least bad option [for them].\u201d",

            "text": "The sound of ice cracking underneath the hull of a 25,500-ton icebreaker is unmistakable. No matter where you are \u2014 shuffling along the lunch line in the galley or sitting on the observation deck with a pack of cards \u2014 the wincing of steel and crunching of ice can shriek through the ship. It's almost ghostly; undeniably haunting.\n\nThe sight of the ice? That's mesmerizing. From the deck of Australia's icebreaker, the RSV Nuyina, on which I sailed to Antarctica for more than five weeks at the start of 2022, it's like looking out over a Martian landscape that's been covered in a coat of stark white paint. In the distance, castles of ice rise from the vast, unbroken ice sheet. At the foot of one fortress, a battalion of King penguins lurks, unfazed by the freezing temperatures. Behind the ship, smaller Adelie penguins avoid a scrap with a leopard seal by climbing onto an island of ice and scurrying away.\n\nSea ice is vital to the Antarctic ecosystem. It's not just a refuge for penguins and other animals, but a fundamental facet of life for creatures further down the food chain too, like Antarctic krill. It means life. The ice is also critical for heat because it's more reflective than water, bouncing back more sunlight than the ocean, and it can act as a physical barrier, impacting the exchange of gases between the ocean and the atmosphere and protecting the continent's ice shelves.\n\nThe Antarctic is currently experiencing the lowest level of sea ice since satellites began taking measurements in 1979. It's an anomaly scientists are concerned about and monitoring closely. It was just a decade ago that sea ice in the Antarctic reached record highs, but generally low extents have been observed since 2016. It's worrying, and could signal a shift in the sea ice dynamics down south, but the situation is more dire at the opposite end of the planet.\n\nThere, at the Earth's northern extreme, the Arctic is experiencing an increase in temperatures two to four times higher than anywhere else in the world, and sea ice has decreased by about 12% per decade since the beginning of the satellite era. About 548,000 square miles of sea ice has been lost since 1979, equivalent to losing an area of ice roughly half the size of India. It's seen a more rapid decline since 2000.\n\nIt's one of the most obvious signs that greenhouse gas emissions are shifting the planet's equilibrium. Researchers say we can take steps to slow the changes, but we need to act with urgency.\n\nThe 4 million people who call the Arctic home rely on the Arctic Ocean for food and transportation. The Indigenous peoples of the Arctic, who make up about 10% of the population, have a vibrant and longstanding cultural connection to the region that is slowly dripping away as regions become free of sea ice for the first time in millennia.\n\nMeanwhile, the distribution of wildlife is shifting and behaviors are changing, altering the interactions between predators and prey. The Arctic's famous polar bears rely on the ice to hunt and now have to travel further to eat, whereas the narwhal, a near-mythic, tusked whale, faces increased threats from killer whales lingering in exposed, warmer waters and disruptions to its migratory patterns.\n\nOur best models currently predict the Arctic will be \"sea ice free\" within the next few decades, perhaps as soon as the 2030s. Antarctica's sea ice is more of a mystery. But at both poles, sea ice is disappearing at an unprecedented rate.\n\nAnd when the ice ends it's not just the ends of the Earth that will change. It's the entire planet.\n\nAn already changed Arctic\n\nThe Arctic Ocean's sea ice expands during the winter, peaking in March, before retreating toward the North Pole. It typically reaches its lowest extent in mid-September. It never completely melts away \u2014 the North Pole itself is typically surrounded, and up to a fifth of the ice in the Arctic is so-called multiyear ice, persisting for more than a year.\n\nOur understanding of this rhythmic pulse in the Northern Hemisphere stretches back for millennia. Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have passed down knowledge of the sea ice's extent for thousands of years, particularly around coastal communities. Iceland's government has been keeping detailed records since the 1600s, while log books and diaries kept during early exploration by ship provide a surprising amount of detail on where and when the Arctic Ocean froze over.\n\nOur ability to understand the ice changed dramatically with the launch of the Nimbus-7 satellite in late 1978. The NASA and NOAA polar-orbiting satellite was fitted with an instrument that provided a way to observe the extent of the sea ice all year round, no matter the weather conditions, by studying the microwave energy bounced back from the surface. Continuous records have been taken since 1979, and the analysis has been deeply troubling. The extent of Arctic sea ice has been decreasing across those four decades, with each of the last 16 years the lowest on record.\n\nVideo: Changes in Arctic sea ice\n\nVideo credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio\n\nFor decades, scientists have tried to pinpoint when the total extent of Arctic sea ice will drop below 1 million square kilometers (or about 386,000 square miles) \u2014 the marker denoting a \"sea ice-free\" summer. In 2009, for instance, one study used climate models to determine that this mark would be hit by 2037. Other research has shown that the timing is unpredictable, with analyses suggesting we might still be decades away.\n\nIn June, a study in the journal Nature Communications analyzed 41 years of satellite data, from 1979 to 2019, reiterating that human greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant force in reduction of Arctic sea ice. It also generated a flurry of worrying headlines focused on the first ice-free summer, citing the near end of a range that it said had shifted to as early as the 2030s to 2050s. But those headlines gloss over a critical point: The current losses of summer sea ice are already having devastating effects.\n\n\"Although the first ice-free Arctic summer has constantly been a point of interest for understanding and communicating climate change, it's more a symbolic threshold in some sense,\" says Zachary Labe, a climate scientist at Princeton University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Arctic climate change is already happening now and in all months of the year.\"\n\nAn Antarctic paradox\n\nFrom the beginning of the satellite era until 2010, Antarctic sea ice experienced a slight increase, with an acceleration in winter sea ice extent between 2012 and 2014. This was unexpected. Global temperatures have unequivocally risen in this time, largely due to human-induced climate change, raising ocean temperatures. Sea ice should've been melting. It didn't.\n\nThe phenomenon was dubbed the Antarctic paradox.\n\nMany climate models haven't been able to reproduce these effects, though at least one high-resolution model has had success. Though explaining the paradox has been difficult, scientists have several hypotheses.\n\nNatalie Robinson, a marine physicist at New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, points out that changing wind patterns, release of freshwater from Antarctica, and ocean stratification could all have played a role over the last four decades, but she says that pointing to one variable as a driver of the increase is virtually impossible. \"In reality, all of these processes act simultaneously and influence each other,\" she notes.\n\nAbout seven years ago, the story began to change. Antarctic sea ice extent plummeted in 2016 and hasn't totally recovered since. In 2023, winter sea ice extent is dramatically lower than we've ever seen in the satellite era.\n\n\"Antarctic sea-ice extent has now adopted a downward trajectory as expected under warming and is congruent with observations of surface warming in the Southern Ocean,\" says Petra Heil, a polar ice scientist with the Australian Antarctic Division. Graphs generated by Labe show the stark decline.\n\nAntarctic sea ice extent in 2023 is the lowest in the satellite era, stretching back to 1978. Zachary Labe\n\nThe record low extent has scientists concerned. Understanding the paradoxical increase over the past four decades could help unlock the reasons behind this sudden change. Does it represent a shift to a worrying new normal? Or is it merely a blip that can be attributed to the normal range of variability?\n\n\"There is certainly a fair bit of concern in the scientific community that it's the former,\" says Robinson.\n\n\"And we are racing to find out.\"\n\nWhen the ice ends\n\nThe great white sheets at either end of the Earth are particularly good at reflecting sunlight. Sea ice covers about 15% of the world's oceans across the year, and up to 70% of the heating energy is reflected back into space. Cover that ice with a dusting of snow and up to 90% can be reflected.\n\nWhen the sea ice disappears, the energy is absorbed by the ocean, raising its temperature. \"In a positive feedback loop this ocean warming leads to even more ice loss and global warming,\" says Heil. She suggests conceptualizing the impact of sea-ice loss by thinking about sea ice as the air conditioning unit of the Earth.\n\nWhen the sea ice disappears, our planetary AC unit is being switched off. It becomes harder to reflect that heat into space and we lose the ability to \"self-regulate\" the Earth's climate.\n\nThe change doesn't affect just the ocean surface and the Earth's air temperatures, though. Sea ice also plays one of the most critical roles on the planet in the ocean's depths. As seawater freezes into ice, salt is expelled, making the surrounding water denser. This heavier, colder water sinks and gets whisked around the planet. Warmer waters are predominantly pushed by wind into the polar regions, then freeze up into ice. The cycle is known as thermohaline circulation.\n\n\"This process can be regarded as the starting point/engine of the global oceans' overturning circulation,\" says Jan Lieser, a sea ice scientist with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and University of Tasmania.\n\nDenser water is pushed across the planet's polar regions by deep currents while warmer waters closer to the surface are affected by wind and pushed toward the poles in what's known as the \"global conveyor belt.\" NOAA\n\nAs the oceans continue to warm at both poles and sea ice extent decreases, this deep ocean current is likely to be disturbed. The knock-on effects could disrupt the polar ecosystems as nutrients and ocean biogeochemistry are altered, particularly in the Southern Ocean, where circulation is also heavily influenced by Antarctic meltwater and the currents already show signs of slowdown.\n\nThe atmosphere and ocean systems are incredibly complex and intertwined. Though the focus has long been on the extent of the sea ice, thickness also plays a role. So does snow cover. These measurements are harder to include in models because they've traditionally been difficult to gather. There are also differences at either pole. The Arctic typically has had thicker sea ice lasting for years, whereas Antarctic sea ice freezes new each year.\n\nIt now seems highly unlikely that the current declines can be stopped but Heil, and her colleague Melinda Webster from the University of Washington, say \"it's possible to slow and mitigate further detrimental effects of a warming climate by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing ways to reduce existing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations to levels that can sustain a habitable climate.\"\n\nOn June 16, Heil and Webster, and more than 60 other polar scientists responded to the changes to the poles by calling for \"urgent intensification of national and international research and observational capabilities in view of rapid Arctic and Antarctic change.\"\n\n\"Action is required now,\" she says, \"to give future generations a fighting chance to mitigate the negative consequences of a warming climate.\"\n\nThe anomaly in Antarctica's sea ice this year, as if sounding its own alarm and affirming Heil's calls, has only continued its downward trajectory.",

When it was constructed at the beginning of last century it served as an Australian rules football oval until redevelopment in 2004, and the ground is now home to Perth Glory\u2019s A-League teams (as well as Super Rugby\u2019s Western Force). International football has been played here before, though just three times, and only once in the women\u2019s game \u2013 in 2018 when the Matildas thrashed Thailand 5-0. While the likes of Pernille Harder and Christine Sinclair will grace the turf in the coming weeks, it was actually Harry Styles who was the last star to play here, performing a concert in February. But before Denmark and China become the next international acts to feature, the venue will undergo a major $32m (\u00a316m) upgrade of facilities, and further temporary fit-outs will be made to make it match ready.\n\nHindmarsh Stadium in Adelaide.

            "text": "The sound of ice cracking underneath the hull of a 25,500-ton icebreaker is unmistakable. No matter where you are \u2014 shuffling along the lunch line in the galley or sitting on the observation deck with a pack of cards \u2014 the wincing of steel and crunching of ice can shriek through the ship. It's almost ghostly; undeniably haunting.\n\nThe sight of the ice? That's mesmerizing. From the deck of Australia's icebreaker, the RSV Nuyina, on which I sailed to Antarctica for more than five weeks at the start of 2022, it's like looking out over a Martian landscape that's been covered in a coat of stark white paint. In the distance, castles of ice rise from the vast, unbroken ice sheet. At the foot of one fortress, a battalion of King penguins lurks, unfazed by the freezing temperatures. Behind the ship, smaller Adelie penguins avoid a scrap with a leopard seal by climbing onto an island of ice and scurrying away.\n\nSea ice is vital to the Antarctic ecosystem. It's not just a refuge for penguins and other animals, but a fundamental facet of life for creatures further down the food chain too, like Antarctic krill. It means life. The ice is also critical for heat because it's more reflective than water, bouncing back more sunlight than the ocean, and it can act as a physical barrier, impacting the exchange of gases between the ocean and the atmosphere and protecting the continent's ice shelves.\n\nThe Antarctic is currently experiencing the lowest level of sea ice since satellites began taking measurements in 1979. It's an anomaly scientists are concerned about and monitoring closely. It was just a decade ago that sea ice in the Antarctic reached record highs, but generally low extents have been observed since 2016. It's worrying, and could signal a shift in the sea ice dynamics down south, but the situation is more dire at the opposite end of the planet.\n\nThere, at the Earth's northern extreme, the Arctic is experiencing an increase in temperatures two to four times higher than anywhere else in the world, and sea ice has decreased by about 12% per decade since the beginning of the satellite era. About 548,000 square miles of sea ice has been lost since 1979, equivalent to losing an area of ice roughly half the size of India. It's seen a more rapid decline since 2000.\n\nIt's one of the most obvious signs that greenhouse gas emissions are shifting the planet's equilibrium. Researchers say we can take steps to slow the changes, but we need to act with urgency.\n\nThe 4 million people who call the Arctic home rely on the Arctic Ocean for food and transportation. The Indigenous peoples of the Arctic, who make up about 10% of the population, have a vibrant and longstanding cultural connection to the region that is slowly dripping away as regions become free of sea ice for the first time in millennia.\n\nMeanwhile, the distribution of wildlife is shifting and behaviors are changing, altering the interactions between predators and prey. The Arctic's famous polar bears rely on the ice to hunt and now have to travel further to eat, whereas the narwhal, a near-mythic, tusked whale, faces increased threats from killer whales lingering in exposed, warmer waters and disruptions to its migratory patterns.\n\nOur best models currently predict the Arctic will be \"sea ice free\" within the next few decades, perhaps as soon as the 2030s. Antarctica's sea ice is more of a mystery. But at both poles, sea ice is disappearing at an unprecedented rate.\n\nAnd when the ice ends it's not just the ends of the Earth that will change. It's the entire planet.\n\nAn already changed Arctic\n\nThe Arctic Ocean's sea ice expands during the winter, peaking in March, before retreating toward the North Pole. It typically reaches its lowest extent in mid-September. It never completely melts away \u2014 the North Pole itself is typically surrounded, and up to a fifth of the ice in the Arctic is so-called multiyear ice, persisting for more than a year.\n\nOur understanding of this rhythmic pulse in the Northern Hemisphere stretches back for millennia. Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have passed down knowledge of the sea ice's extent for thousands of years, particularly around coastal communities. Iceland's government has been keeping detailed records since the 1600s, while log books and diaries kept during early exploration by ship provide a surprising amount of detail on where and when the Arctic Ocean froze over.\n\nOur ability to understand the ice changed dramatically with the launch of the Nimbus-7 satellite in late 1978. The NASA and NOAA polar-orbiting satellite was fitted with an instrument that provided a way to observe the extent of the sea ice all year round, no matter the weather conditions, by studying the microwave energy bounced back from the surface. Continuous records have been taken since 1979, and the analysis has been deeply troubling. The extent of Arctic sea ice has been decreasing across those four decades, with each of the last 16 years the lowest on record.\n\nVideo: Changes in Arctic sea ice\n\nVideo credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio\n\nFor decades, scientists have tried to pinpoint when the total extent of Arctic sea ice will drop below 1 million square kilometers (or about 386,000 square miles) \u2014 the marker denoting a \"sea ice-free\" summer. In 2009, for instance, one study used climate models to determine that this mark would be hit by 2037. Other research has shown that the timing is unpredictable, with analyses suggesting we might still be decades away.\n\nIn June, a study in the journal Nature Communications analyzed 41 years of satellite data, from 1979 to 2019, reiterating that human greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant force in reduction of Arctic sea ice. It also generated a flurry of worrying headlines focused on the first ice-free summer, citing the near end of a range that it said had shifted to as early as the 2030s to 2050s. But those headlines gloss over a critical point: The current losses of summer sea ice are already having devastating effects.\n\n\"Although the first ice-free Arctic summer has constantly been a point of interest for understanding and communicating climate change, it's more a symbolic threshold in some sense,\" says Zachary Labe, a climate scientist at Princeton University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Arctic climate change is already happening now and in all months of the year.\"\n\nAn Antarctic paradox\n\nFrom the beginning of the satellite era until 2010, Antarctic sea ice experienced a slight increase, with an acceleration in winter sea ice extent between 2012 and 2014. This was unexpected. Global temperatures have unequivocally risen in this time, largely due to human-induced climate change, raising ocean temperatures. Sea ice should've been melting. It didn't.\n\nThe phenomenon was dubbed the Antarctic paradox.\n\nMany climate models haven't been able to reproduce these effects, though at least one high-resolution model has had success. Though explaining the paradox has been difficult, scientists have several hypotheses.\n\nNatalie Robinson, a marine physicist at New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, points out that changing wind patterns, release of freshwater from Antarctica, and ocean stratification could all have played a role over the last four decades, but she says that pointing to one variable as a driver of the increase is virtually impossible. \"In reality, all of these processes act simultaneously and influence each other,\" she notes.\n\nAbout seven years ago, the story began to change. Antarctic sea ice extent plummeted in 2016 and hasn't totally recovered since. In 2023, winter sea ice extent is dramatically lower than we've ever seen in the satellite era.\n\n\"Antarctic sea-ice extent has now adopted a downward trajectory as expected under warming and is congruent with observations of surface warming in the Southern Ocean,\" says Petra Heil, a polar ice scientist with the Australian Antarctic Division. Graphs generated by Labe show the stark decline.\n\nAntarctic sea ice extent in 2023 is the lowest in the satellite era, stretching back to 1978. Zachary Labe\n\nThe record low extent has scientists concerned. Understanding the paradoxical increase over the past four decades could help unlock the reasons behind this sudden change. Does it represent a shift to a worrying new normal? Or is it merely a blip that can be attributed to the normal range of variability?\n\n\"There is certainly a fair bit of concern in the scientific community that it's the former,\" says Robinson.\n\n\"And we are racing to find out.\"\n\nWhen the ice ends\n\nThe great white sheets at either end of the Earth are particularly good at reflecting sunlight. Sea ice covers about 15% of the world's oceans across the year, and up to 70% of the heating energy is reflected back into space. Cover that ice with a dusting of snow and up to 90% can be reflected.\n\nWhen the sea ice disappears, the energy is absorbed by the ocean, raising its temperature. \"In a positive feedback loop this ocean warming leads to even more ice loss and global warming,\" says Heil. She suggests conceptualizing the impact of sea-ice loss by thinking about sea ice as the air conditioning unit of the Earth.\n\nWhen the sea ice disappears, our planetary AC unit is being switched off. It becomes harder to reflect that heat into space and we lose the ability to \"self-regulate\" the Earth's climate.\n\nThe change doesn't affect just the ocean surface and the Earth's air temperatures, though. Sea ice also plays one of the most critical roles on the planet in the ocean's depths. As seawater freezes into ice, salt is expelled, making the surrounding water denser. This heavier, colder water sinks and gets whisked around the planet. Warmer waters are predominantly pushed by wind into the polar regions, then freeze up into ice. The cycle is known as thermohaline circulation.\n\n\"This process can be regarded as the starting point/engine of the global oceans' overturning circulation,\" says Jan Lieser, a sea ice scientist with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and University of Tasmania.\n\nDenser water is pushed across the planet's polar regions by deep currents while warmer waters closer to the surface are affected by wind and pushed toward the poles in what's known as the \"global conveyor belt.\" NOAA\n\nAs the oceans continue to warm at both poles and sea ice extent decreases, this deep ocean current is likely to be disturbed. The knock-on effects could disrupt the polar ecosystems as nutrients and ocean biogeochemistry are altered, particularly in the Southern Ocean, where circulation is also heavily influenced by Antarctic meltwater and the currents already show signs of slowdown.\n\nThe atmosphere and ocean systems are incredibly complex and intertwined. Though the focus has long been on the extent of the sea ice, thickness also plays a role. So does snow cover. These measurements are harder to include in models because they've traditionally been difficult to gather. There are also differences at either pole. The Arctic typically has had thicker sea ice lasting for years, whereas Antarctic sea ice freezes new each year.\n\nIt now seems highly unlikely that the current declines can be stopped but Heil, and her colleague Melinda Webster from the University of Washington, say \"it's possible to slow and mitigate further detrimental effects of a warming climate by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing ways to reduce existing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations to levels that can sustain a habitable climate.\"\n\nOn June 16, Heil and Webster, and more than 60 other polar scientists responded to the changes to the poles by calling for \"urgent intensification of national and international research and observational capabilities in view of rapid Arctic and Antarctic change.\"\n\n\"Action is required now,\" she says, \"to give future generations a fighting chance to mitigate the negative consequences of a warming climate.\"\n\nThe anomaly in Antarctica's sea ice this year, as if sounding its own alarm and affirming Heil's calls, has only continued its downward trajectory.",

That's largely because of the billions of dollars the country is spending on green technologies through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Congressional Democrats passed last summer, according to a new report from Rhodium Group.\n\nThe research firm says that by 2030, the U.S. could lower its greenhouse gas emissions by 29% to 42%, compared to 2005 pollution levels. At the start of the Biden administration, Rhodium Group analysts said it looked like the country would only be able to cut its emissions by about a quarter, at most. The changed outlook reflects expectations that huge investments by the federal government will make things like renewable energy and electric vehicles a lot more affordable.\n\nBut big barriers still stand in the way. Companies that build wind and solar plants often struggle to get projects permitted by local governments because of public opposition. And there are long waiting lines to plug in power plants and batteries to the country's electric grids. To make the kinds of emissions cuts that the Rhodium Group says are possible, the U.S. will have to at least match its best-ever year for wind and solar development, and it will have to do it year after year.\n\nAnd even if everything goes right, it still won't be enough to deliver on a pledge the U.S. made under the 2015 Paris Agreement to cut its emissions in half by the end of this decade. Meeting that target will require even more aggressive actions by states and the federal government, Rhodium Group says.\n\n\"You're gonna need to figure out how to build out a whole bunch of wind and solar, get a bunch of electric vehicles on the road and that kind of thing,\" says Ben King, an associate director in the firm's energy and climate practice.\n\n\"The IRA is the push, the economic push that you need, and you just gotta clear the way for it and not let it encounter so many headwinds,\" King adds.\n\nA recent report from the United Nations warned that the world is running out of time to keep temperatures from rising to levels that could be catastrophic for many places. The Earth is already nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it was in the late 1800s, and it's on track to exceed 5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming by the end of the century, according to the U.N. Beyond about 2.8 degrees Fahrenheit of warming, storms, heat waves and other climate impacts become far more destructive.\n\nLimiting the rise in global temperatures will require an international response. But as the largest historical contributor to climate change, the U.S. \"needs to lead that effort,\" says Aiguo Dai, a professor of atmospheric and environmental science at the University of Albany.\n\n\"If the U.S. can start cutting down the emissions, steadily year over year, decade over decade, then we are on the right path to limit global warming,\" Dai says.\n\nHowever, scientists say time is of the essence. At the slow current pace countries are cutting emissions, warming is on track to trigger runaway impacts that could lead to permanent changes in the Earth's ecosystems.\n\n\"If we cut it too [slowly], it could be difficult to avoid catastrophic warming in the near future,\" Dai says.",

But lately, the emphasis has been on the number of jobs created by the law \u2014 overshadowing what the projects collectively mean for the push to limit the country's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTake, for instance, a recent stop of the Bidenomics tour, where the president's top climate aide, Ali Zaidi, joined Maryland's Democratic governor, Wes Moore, at a row house near Carver Vocational-Technical High School. Students are renovating the house while learning green building techniques.\n\nZaidi told NPR that the green jobs programs are making a material difference in the lives of Americans.\n\n\"We see it here in Baltimore, where folks are getting enlisted to help retrofit our buildings \u2014 and they now have wind in their sails thanks to the president's climate agenda,\" Zaidi said.\n\nShould Biden talk more about his climate successes?\n\nBiden has long linked climate change and job creation in his political rhetoric, making it a staple of his speeches during his 2020 campaign.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden identified addressing climate change as one of his top four priorities, and his administration has focused on climate and environmental policies.\n\nWhen Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law a year ago, he talked at length about how its clean energy investments would help the climate. Now, as his reelection campaign gears up, the bill's economic upsides have taken center stage in his broader 'Bidenomics' message.\n\n\"This bill includes the biggest investment ever, not only in America but anywhere in the world, when dealing with climate change,\" Biden told a crowd of union workers in Philadelphia during the first big rally of his campaign. \"And the investment isn't only going to help us save the planet. It's going to create jobs \u2014 lots of jobs, tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\"\n\nPolitically, a focus on the economy makes sense: Voters consistently rank it as the issue that is most important to them and have expressed concern about Biden's handling of it.\n\nLinking climate to jobs helps the president expand support for policies to tackle the climate crisis. \"This dual message was central to building the unprecedented coalition of labor groups, industry, and environmental justice leaders that helped us secure the biggest climate protection bill in history,\" said Abdullah Hasan, a White House spokesperson.\n\nBiden's reelection effort is supported by four prominent environmental organizations \u2014 as well as the major labor group AFL-CIO.\n\nBut the economic emphasis has left some voters in the dark about the considerable climate wins that the administration secured with the legislation. The Inflation Reduction Act is projected to spur a 40% reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from a 2005 baseline by 2030.\n\nApproval of Biden's performance on climate has waned\n\nSince the Inflation Reduction Act was signed, approval for Biden's handling of climate change and the environment has declined. That's according to polling by Data for Progress, which does work for Democratic candidates and causes.\n\nThe drop was most dramatic among voters under age 30.\n\nKoray Gates, 21, is a student in Colorado Springs, Colo., who says climate change is one of his top issues. He said he is frustrated by some of the decisions made during Biden's time in office.\n\n\"[Biden] does things like, you know, allowing drilling in the Arctic again. And so,\" Gates said, \"it kind of undermines my faith a little bit.\"\n\nIn March, Biden approved a large drilling project, known as Willow, on federal land in Alaska, north of the Arctic Circle, provoking intense backlash from environmental groups and young, climate-motivated voters.\n\n\"President Biden is by far the best climate president we've had, but he's also broken some key climate promises,\" said Ed Maibach, who studies climate communication at George Mason University. \"Those broken promises have been a profound disappointment to some of his voters, especially young voters.\"\n\nMeanwhile, most Democratic voters have still not heard much about Biden's signature climate law, according to Maibach's research.\n\n\"I don't think the president has spent enough time or effort convincing Americans what a big deal the [Inflation Reduction Act] is,\" Maibach said. \"To quote Cool Hand Luke, 'What we've got here is a failure to communicate.'\"\n\nThe White House says these messages take time\n\nWhen Zaidi, Biden's climate adviser, was asked whether he was concerned about young voters' frustration or the lack of awareness about the Inflation Reduction Act, he said he thought the situation would improve with time.\n\n\"I think that young people \u2014 thanks to the administration's work, thanks to the president's leadership \u2014 are going to be able to get onto a school bus that doesn't pollute. They are going to see the Postal Service fleet \u2014 that touches every home and every street in every part of the county \u2014 go fully electric,\" Zaidi told NPR.\n\n\"The president could not feel more urgently the need to move forward, and he has done just that,\" Zaidi said.\n\nMeanwhile, young voters concerned about climate change seem unlikely to shift their support away from Biden and his party, given that Republicans have said they want to scale back Biden's climate initiatives and support increased domestic fossil fuel production.\n\nGates, the 21-year-old student, said that despite his frustrations with Biden, he can't imagine voting for a Republican challenger in the 2024 election \u2014 and doesn't think he or his friends would opt to sit the election out.\n\n\"It's really important to vote, even if the person who you're voting for is not perfect,\" Gates said, \"even if not everything is as you would want it.\"",

            "text": "Improved camera features and updated specs are usually touted by smartphone manufacturers, but a new player in the US market is banking on social responsibility.\n\nMurena's Fairphone 4 is made from \"fairly sourced and recycled materials\" by workers who are paid a living wage, according to the Dutch manufacturer.\n\nAvailable in Europe since 2021, the device has finally landed in the US. It's powered by Murena's /e/ operating system, a modified take on the Android OS that Murena says is designed to protect user privacy.\n\nIn a statement, Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens called the launch \"a great opportunity for us to pilot selling devices in the US ... and learn more about the American market.\"\n\nThe Fairphone 4's modular design makes it easy to repair and customize, thereby postponing a full upgrade: The battery is removable, and the camera array, USB-C port, loudspeaker and body are all individual components, with replacement parts available to US customers on the Murena website. The company says repairs can be made with a standard screwdriver.\n\nThe Fairphone 4's components are individual and can be removed and replaced by the user. Murena\n\nEven the Fairphone's five-year warranty outstrips the iPhone's standard one-year guarantee.\n\nThe phone market has matured to the point where companies don't really have anything new to offer, Murena CEO Ga\u00ebl Duval told CNET in an email, \"just a few more megapixels on the camera.\" (For what it's worth, the Murena Fairphone 4 features a dual 48-megapixel rear camera and a 25-megapixel front-facing camera.)\n\n\"With sustainability and privacy combined, we are answering new and growing market needs,\" Duval added. \"Who really needs more megapixels while the planet is heating and the climate is changing so fast?\"\n\nThe Fairphone 4 is the only option in the US market that's TCO Certified, a sustainability certification for IT products that examines socially responsible manufacturing, environmental impact, user health and safety, product lifetime extension and other factors. It also carries the German government's Blue Angel label, awarded based on durability, energy efficiency, recyclability and emissions.\n\nThe phone doesn't even come with a USB cord, plug or headphones, as Murena says it wants to encourage customers to use accessories they already have around the house.\n\nBeyond sustainability, the Fairphone is a standout in user privacy. While Google has paid millions to settle data privacy and location-tracking lawsuits, Murena says its /e/ OS is a DeGoogled version of Android.\n\n\"We don't scan your data in your phone or in your cloud space, and we don't track your location hundred times a day or collect what you're doing with your apps,\" a statement on the company's website says.\n\nYou can still download Google apps if you want, The Verge reported, but Murena says it snags them directly from the Play Store without giving Google your personal details.\n\nThere are some tradeoffs, including the choice of carriers: Using a Fairphone 4 with anyone besides T-Mobile \"is not recommended,\" according to Murena.\n\nThere's also the wait. Per the Murena website, the phone is currently only available on backorder.\n\nPricing for the Fairphone 4 starts at $629 for 128GB of storage or $699 for a 256GB device.\n\nPhone repairability is becoming more important for buyers. Google has been partnering with iFixit to sell replacement parts for its Pixel phones since last year, including for its new Pixel Fold, and Apple, Samsung and Microsoft similarly sell DIY fix-it parts for their phones and tablets.\n\nRead more: Pixel 7 Pro Review: Google's Best Flagship Phone Gets Better",

            "text": "House passes defense bill mostly along party lines with culture war measures attached\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nThe House has narrowly passed its defense authorization bill mostly along party lines, shattering a nearly 60-year precedent of passing the annual package with significant bipartisan support.\n\nThe vote was 219-210, with four Republicans opposing the package and four Democrats backing it.\n\n\"Under this bill, men and women in uniform who make sacrifices for our nation every day will receive the biggest pay raise in decades,\" said House Speaker Kevin McCarthy after the vote Friday morning. \"Radical programs that are forced on troops at the expense of readiness are now eliminated, cutting edge technology that is essential for the future of this country and to keep freedom around the world from the rise of China and Russia will receive more investment than we've watched in the past.\"\n\nMcCarthy agreed to demands from a group of conservatives who threatened to block a vote on the annual defense measure unless their amendments on a range of far right policies were allowed. House Republicans were successful in pushing through amendments on various social policies, including a measure eliminating the Pentagon's offices of diversity, equity and inclusion, and a measure denying health care coverage for transgender-related medical treatments for service members.\n\n\"The military needs to be focused on readiness and lethality and all these other things are distractors from that and harm our national security,\" Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., told reporters Friday.\n\nA pivotal moment in the course of the debate this week came from Texas GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson, whose amendment would prohibit the Defense Department from paying or reimbursing travel expenses related to abortion care for service members \u2014 a policy implemented by the Pentagon after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"The days of the radical left ignoring the law and pushing their destructive social agenda in the military are done,\" Jackson said on the House floor Thursday.\n\nDemocratic backlash was swift.\n\n\"As leaders of the Pro-Choice Caucus, we are outraged at House Republicans' attempt to force their extreme anti-abortion agenda onto America's servicemembers in what should be a bipartisan bill,\" Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee of California and Diana DeGette of Colorado said in a statement.\n\n\"It's a shame that House Republicans would use women to defend our nation on battlefields, but refuse to trust them to make their own healthcare decisions. Our servicemembers fight for our freedoms. As lawmakers, we should be working to protect their freedoms\u2014not trying to take their rights away.\"\n\nThe abortion amendment echoes a similar controversy playing out in the Senate, where Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville has been blocking military promotions until the Defense Department revokes the policy.\n\nThe various culture war amendments effectively acted as poison pills for most Democrats, who couldn't stomach supporting the package with the attached amendments.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., a former Navy helicopter pilot, told reporters she backed the bill coming out of the House Armed Services committee, but voted no on Friday because of the added measures on abortion and other social issues.\n\n\"They've turned a bipartisan defense bill into a vehicle to drive a really out-of-touch culture war agenda \u2013 an agenda that attacks service members ... who are women, LGBTQ and people of color,\" she said.\n\nAnother female veteran who opposed the bill, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., said she was surprised that more Republicans who expressed concerns about adding controversial issues to the bill ended up backing the abortion amendment.\n\nShe thought as many as 15 would oppose it, but in the end, only 2 broke ranks.\n\n\"This is absolutely a back door to banning abortions across the nation,\" Houlahan said.\n\nBoth Sherrill and Houlahan waved off any political blowback for voting against other measures in the bill like pay raises for service members, saying their constituents know about their military backgrounds and they were skeptical these measures would advance in the Senate.\n\nAnother example of outsize influence of House Freedom caucus\n\nThe Armed Services Committee passed the bill 58-1 last month.\n\nIn a statement Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the top Democrat on that committee, along with other senior Democrats on the committee, said they wouldn't vote for the defense package's passage in light of the slew of GOP amendments.\n\n\"What was once an example of compromise and functioning government has become an ode to bigotry and ignorance. Attacks on reproductive rights, access to basic health care, and efforts to address our country's history of racism and marginalization of huge swaths of our country will worsen our recruitment and retention crisis, make our military less capable, and do grievous harm to our national defense and national security,\" the statement read.\n\nThe fact that a bill that was expected to have bipartisan support ended up with only a handful of Democrats supporting it throws McCarthy's very narrow majority into stark relief and provides another example of the speaker acquiescing to the demands of the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in order to pass legislation.\n\nThe speaker agreed to a range of amendments to avoid a repeat of a recent episode when Freedom Caucus members defeated a procedural vote to debate an energy bill because they disagreed with McCarthy's strategy on the debt limit. This time, McCarthy gave in to their push to allow debates and votes on the floor on both funding for Ukraine and a host of social issues that many moderates worried would draw backlash from voters, and weren't expected to advance in the Senate.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., pressed to strip out the additional $300 million for Ukraine, but that effort failed. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., another opponent of U.S. military assistance in Ukraine, offered an amendment to withdraw that aid, but it was overwhelmingly defeated.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders accused Republicans of using the bill as a means to push a conservative social policy agenda.\n\n\"Extreme MAGA Republicans have chosen to hijack the historically bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act to continue attacking reproductive freedom and jamming their right-wing ideology down the throats of the American people,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, caucus chair Pete Aguilar, and whip Katherine Clark said in a statement earlier this week. \"House Republicans have turned what should be a meaningful investment in our men and women in uniform into an extreme and reckless legislative joyride.\"\n\nEven though it passed the House, the defense package is likely dead-on-arrival in the Senate, given the various changes from the GOP.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has already said the Senate will take up its own version of the package, teeing up partisan clashes when the two chambers reconcile their bills. He is aiming to vote on a bill by the end of the month.\n\nAsked about the path ahead in the Senate, McCarthy said he \"hope[s] the bills that come out of the House are different than the bills that Schumer's in charge of.\"\n\n\"You know what? We designed our government to be this way because then we go to conference and we find where we can unite,\" he told reporters.\n\nEarlier this week the White House released a statement on the House bill that noted the many bipartisan elements that boosted Pentagon priorities, but it also listed a host of provisions it opposed.\n\nOn changes to existing diversity initiatives the White House stated: \"Legislation that reduces DoD's ability to create a positive work environment and fully leverage the best our nation has to offer puts the Department at a strategic disadvantage.\"",

Officials tallied thousands of \"excess deaths\" during that period, and this study specifically analyzes how many were a result of the heat.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from the Eurostat mortality database for 35 countries to estimate that 61,672 people died from heat-related illness between May 30 and September 4. Italy, Spain and Germany had the highest number of heat-attributable deaths overall.\n\nThe staggering figure suggests that European countries are struggling to adapt to the effects of climate change, even in the wake of a deadly 2003 heat wave that caused more than 70,000 excess deaths across the continent.\n\nThe disaster led many countries (especially France) to implement heat prevention plans and other adaptation strategies aimed at protecting vulnerable populations, the study says, though \"the evidence of their effectiveness is still limited.\"\n\n\"The fact that more than 61,600 people in Europe died of heat stress in the summer of 2022, even though, unlike in 2003, many countries already had active prevention plans in place, suggests that the adaptation strategies currently available may still be insufficient,\" researcher Hicham Achebak, one of the study's authors, said in a press release.\n\nWithout further action, the researchers warn, those numbers could continue to worsen drastically in the years ahead.\n\nBy 2030, the continent could see more than 68,000 heat-related deaths every summer. By 2050, each summer's deaths could top 120,000.\n\nProlonged waves of extreme heat are projected to increase significantly across Europe, especially in southern regions, Chiara Martinelli, the director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, told NPR over email.\n\nShe stressed that heat waves are \"extremely deadly\" and disproportionately impact vulnerable, isolated and marginalized groups.\n\nMartinelli is calling on governments to step up their efforts to limit global warming. And, along with the study's authors, she says these findings underscore the need for stronger heat prevention and adaption plans.\n\n\"Governments need to [prioritize] adaptation measures to be better prepared and deal effectively with extreme weather events, while ensuring the protection of all populations,\" Martinelli wrote.\n\nWomen and elderly people were most affected\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ina Fassbender/AFP via Getty Images Ina Fassbender/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Nature study zooms in on specific countries and demographic groups to examine the impact of extreme heat.\n\nIt notes that Italy had the most heat-attributable deaths over the course of the whole summer, with 18,010, followed by Spain (11,324) and Germany (8,173).\n\nItaly also ranked first in terms of heat-related mortality rate, with 295 deaths per million, followed by Greece (280), Spain (237) and Portugal (211). For reference, Europe's average was an estimated 114 deaths per million.\n\nThe researchers also looked at how much hotter the summer was than those in the past.\n\nFrance fared the worst: Summer 2022 was about 4.4 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the 1991 to 2020 average. Switzerland, Italy, Hungary and Spain were not far behind. And even that small-sounding number can have big health effects.\n\nThe authors say their findings emphasize the vulnerability of populations in Southern Europe.\n\n\"As a major climate change hotspot, these populations will be increasingly exposed to extreme summer conditions and would therefore be expected to experience increasingly higher heat-related mortality in the future,\" they explain.\n\nThe data also show a significant increase in mortality in older age groups \u2014 the vast majority of heat-related deaths were in people 80 years and up \u2014 and especially in women.\n\nWomen were much more vulnerable to the heat than men. Over the course of the summer, 35,406 women died, compared to 21,667 men.\n\nThe researchers do not explain why, but point to \"physiological differences and sociocultural factors\" among the potential explanations.\n\n\"We also found that differences in age structure between men and women partly explained the higher risk for women at advanced ages and for men at younger ages,\" they added, referring to the distribution of the population according to age.\n\nWhat heat does to the body\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cristina Quicler/AFP via Getty Images Cristina Quicler/AFP via Getty Images\n\nExtreme heat can take both an immediate and long-term toll on the human body.\n\nIt can make people sweat more and cause dehydration, Dr. Ari Bernstein of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health told NPR last year. It can also directly create more heat in the body, which can keep the heart, brain, lungs or other organs from working properly. The consequences can be enormous.\n\n\"People who have existing heart problems, lung problems, kidney problems, even mental health issues, they get sicker,\" Bernstein said. \"And even for people who are in generally good health, the heat can be really dangerous if we don't pay attention.\"\n\nOther groups that are especially vulnerable to heat include infants, people in their 60s and older, outdoor workers with little control over their working conditions and people with certain health conditions or taking blood pressure drugs or other medications that can limit the body's ability to regulate temperature.\n\nExtreme heat can lead to potentially deadly illnesses like heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and contribute to deaths from heart attacks, strokes and other forms of cardiovascular disease, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers guidance about how to spot and respond to signs of heat-related illness.\n\nFor example, someone experiencing symptoms of heat exhaustion should move to a cool place, loosen their clothes, sip water and get medical help if they start throwing up or see symptoms either get worse or last more than an hour.\n\nIf someone is suffering from heat stroke, they should be cooled down with wet cloths or an ice bath and receive medical attention immediately.\n\nWhat Europe can do\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sean Gallup/Getty Images Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe researchers call on European countries to reevaluate and strengthen their surveillance, prevention and adaptation strategies.\n\nAnd they say those prevention plans should also \"target a reduction of sex, age and other drivers of inequalities in the risk of heat-related mortality.\"\n\nAdaptation strategies can take several forms, as Clean Energy Wire explains. They range from using technology to help infrastructure and people better cope with extreme weather, like building seawalls to protect against flooding, to nature-based solutions like planting trees to bring shade and reduce the temperature of the air.\n\nThe Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre released a 96-page guide in 2019 with steps that cities can take \u2014 before, during and after a heat wave \u2014 to reduce the risk and save lives.\n\nIt stresses actions like planning for the heat season, creating warning systems, improving public safety messaging and implementing urban planning strategies to manage heat risk in the long term. Some of those include green roofs, reflective or permeable pavements, car-free zones and water services.\n\nThere's also the question of limiting future warming. Martinelli, of CAN Europe, says countries must do more to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7 degrees F) above pre-industrial levels.\n\nFuture warming depends on future emissions, NASA chief scientist and senior climate adviser Katherine Calvin told Morning Edition on Wednesday. She says science can help people make decisions about what actions to prioritize.\n\n\"We know more about our planet than we ever have, there are scientists and engineers all around the world that are learning more every day, we're able to provide that information publicly,\" she said. \"And we have options available today that can help us respond to climate change, whether that's options available to help reduce emissions or adapt to changes we experience, those all exist now.\"\n\nWhat this all means for the U.S.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brandon Bell/Getty Images Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nEurope's plight may hold lessons for other parts of the world, too.\n\nThe Southwest United States, for example, is experiencing extreme heat this week.\n\nThe country sees an average of 702 heat-related deaths each year, per the CDC. But specific heat waves, such as the one that hit the Northwest in 2021, have killed hundreds of people in a matter of days.\n\nSo why are the U.S. numbers so much lower than Europe's?\n\nExperts say the heat could be more deadly in Europe because of the lack of air conditioning (only one in 10 European households had A/C as of last year, compared to nearly 90% of U.S. households). Plus, the U.S. could be underreporting its numbers, as one 2020 study found.\n\nThe CDC says some of those illnesses and death risks have diminished in recent decades, possibly because of better forecasting, heat-healthy early warning systems and increased access to air conditioning.\n\nBut, it warns, extreme heat events are still a cause of preventable death nationwide \u2014 and an ever-growing risk as the climate heats up further.",

Thick forests blanket the land and fast rivers produce carbon-free hydropower. It's here, just south of the Arctic Circle, where a Swedish startup called Northvolt has launched its bid to power electric cars around the world.\n\nFormed seven years ago, Northvolt is the first homegrown European battery company. In an interview with NPR, its CEO Peter Carlsson says the company was created to help make the continent self-sufficient on the batteries that will power the future of energy \u2014 and less dependent on China.\n\n\"Europe was not really having any supply chains,\" he says. \"We were all very, very Asia dependent. That was the key driver why we started this.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\ntoggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nNorthvolt hopes to compete in the race for control of the battery industry, which is key to the global economy and for stemming climate change. Batteries, like those made with lithium ion, are used for everything from cellphones to wind turbines and electric vehicles. The industry is currently dominated by China. Northvolt is trying to challenge that dominance, but it takes a vast effort that's literally clearing the landscape and redefining a city.\n\nAs with most startups, there were challenges at the beginning, including funding, COVID-19 and supply chain issues. Carlsson, a former Tesla executive, says at times there was doubt the company would survive.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\n\"It was 2019 or 2020, there was a bunch of headlines around, you know, 'Northvolt running out of juice,' and 'is this going to fail?' etc.,\" he says. \"It's not for fainthearted, and specifically when it comes to large-scale industrial projects.\"\n\nNorthvolt secured backing from powerful investors such as Goldman Sachs, as well as European carmakers like Volvo and Volkswagen, which allowed the company to, among other things, launch a \"gigafactory\" in the far northern Swedish city of Skelleftea to produce lithium ion batteries.\n\nRoughly a million trees were cleared and tons of stone dynamited and removed to make way for the plant, says Joachim Nordin, the CEO of the local power station Skelleftea Kraft. The Northvolt plant will have 100% renewable energy at an affordable cost from nearby hydropower plants.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\n\"If you look at the northern part of Sweden, we have all the big rivers and a lot of them are exploited with hydropower stations,\" he says. \"Hydropower is the biggest energy source in Sweden.\"\n\nConstruction at the Northvolt plant, which started in 2019, is behind schedule. Only about one-third of the massive plant has been built. Roads are still being constructed. Shipping containers stacked two high are used for offices. But it's growing fast, says Christopher Gorelczenko, one of the company's executives, as he accompanied NPR on a tour of the Northvolt plant.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\n\"When I got here in December 2020, this building we are in now had four exterior walls, that was about it,\" he says. \"These clean rooms, you see, were not here.\"\n\nGorelczenko moved to Skelleftea with his wife, five sons, two cats and two dogs, during the pandemic. He oversees the launch of one of Northvolt's products, although he won't say what it is or which customer it's for. Such information is tightly held at Northvolt. Looking through windows, you can see technicians in protective uniforms and face masks working near large rolls of copper and aluminum used in the batteries. But visitors are forbidden in areas where battery cells are produced.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\n\"Everything is proprietary,\" Gorelczenko says. \"This is an industry that does not exist much outside of Asia at this point. And everybody keeps their stuff very, very close.\"\n\nGorelczenko, who previously worked for Tesla and Jeff Bezos' space exploration company Blue Origin, says post-pandemic there are still plenty of lingering challenges \u2014 including finding skilled workers needed for this type of work.\n\n\"It's very challenging because it's an industry that is not normalized to Sweden. So it's a new industry in a new area with new people who don't have this type of background,\" he says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nNorthvolt is bringing in skilled workers from all over the world to work at the plant. Skelleftea is booming. The influx of 3,000 new residents \u2014 adults and children \u2014 over the past few years is placing a strain on this small municipality of about 75,000 people. There aren't enough schools or medical workers for the newcomers, and more roads will have to be built, says Helena Renstrom, marketing manager with the Skelleftea Municipality. Housing is an issue.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\n\"Looking back 20 years, we ... maybe built, I don't know, 20 or 50 houses,\" she says. \"Now we are up in 800 per year,\" which she says is a lot for a small city.\n\nAt a waterpark along Skelleftea's riverbanks, Habib Waqar watches his wife and young daughter play. They're from Karachi, Pakistan, and arrived in Skelleftea in March. Waqar, who works at Northvolt, says their biggest challenge in their new home was finding a place to live.\n\n\"It's pretty hard to find the housing \u2014 everywhere in Sweden, it's pretty hard \u2014 but yes, we found, we got it. We got it,\" he says.\n\nOn a recent warm Sunday, the local beer garden in the center of Skelleftea was filled with Swedes \u2014 mostly white and mostly blond. Asa Larsson, a social worker in Skelleftea who is enjoying a beer, says there have been a lot of changes in the city over the past couple of years. She says it's a good thing, there are more restaurants and interesting people.\n\n\"We were a small town with a small town culture, and now we're like everyone from the world is coming in and make [it] richer,\" she says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nThe Northvolt plant is also bringing back some of Skelleftea's own. Sofia Lindstrom, a regional coordinator for the chamber of commerce, says for years young people have been moving away because of a lack of opportunities. \"They didn't have any work ... so they moved to Stockholm or [other] bigger cities in Sweden to find work,\" she says that's now reversed. \"They are coming back now ... so that's nice.\"\n\nNorthvolt plans on a 4,000-strong workforce at its Skelleftea plant. It's also expanding into another part of Sweden, as well as Poland and Norway. The United States is also a possibility. The American battery industry is more robust than Europe's, but still lags behind China. CEO Carlsson says he's interested in the U.S. because of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax breaks and other incentives.\n\n\"You know, if you come here and put a factory, we will subsidize so much of your production up until 2032,\" he says, describing President Biden's policy. \"So it's a fairly transparent program ... and very fast moving.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nora Lorek for NPR Nora Lorek for NPR\n\nThat produced a subsidy battle between Europe and the U.S. Berlin offered Northvolt a subsidy package worth about $1 billion to build a plant in Germany. Northvolt agreed, but Carlsson says it's still interested in a U.S. plant.\n\nThat's a lot of expansion, especially as Europe depends heavily on China for the critical raw minerals \u2014 such as lithium and cobalt \u2014 that are used in the batteries. Carlsson says Northvolt is trying to create new sustainable supply chains to break China's grip.\n\n\"Such as, for example, Canada, also in Australia,\" he says. \"And we are actually building a supply chain in Portugal together ... with a joint venture for lithium.\"\n\nCarlsson believes technologically, Northvolt can compete with China's battery makers. But he says the Asian companies are better at scaling up \u2014 producing more batteries faster.\n\n\"This is where we need to just be learning faster and be better,\" he says. \"This will drive where we will end up ... how fast we can scale this business. They are incredibly good at it.\"\n\nCurrently, Northvolt is making enough to supply about 15,000 electronic vehicles a year. That's expected to increase to about a million car batteries once construction at the plant is completed in 2027. Meanwhile, there are more than three dozen new battery factories in the works in Europe in the coming years.",

Netanyahu previously paused his plans to limit the power of the courts in March due to similar protests. But Israel's parliament recently gave initial approval to a bill that would block courts from intervening in appointments and decisions of elected officials that they deem unreasonable.\n\nNPR's Daniel Estrin is in the streets reporting from what he calls a \"reenergized nationwide, nonviolent protest movement.\" He spoke to a protester, who told him the people of Israel \"need help from the U.S. to protect us.\" He says protesters want to keep pressure on the Biden administration \u2014 which hasn't invited Netanyahu to the White House yet.\n\nAs the South continues to experience dangerous extreme heat, parts of the Northeast are being drenched by heavy rains and flash flooding.

And there was Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Coretta Scott King famously said that the fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation. We are that generation she spoke of,\" said the vice president onstage Friday at the 29th Essence Festival of Culture. \"So, fight we must.\"\n\nTens of thousands of people showed up this past weekend for the Essence Festival in New Orleans, where Vice President Harris headlined panel conversations about economic opportunity and maternal health and reproductive rights. On both days she spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court issued monumental decisions that ended the use of race as a factor in college admissions and blocked the Biden administration's attempt to forgive student loan debt. It also ruled that businesses could refuse LGBTQ customers.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Abdul Aziz for NPR Abdul Aziz for NPR\n\n\"This is a serious moment and fundamental issues are at stake,\" Harris told NPR's Michel Martin in her first interview after the court decisions at the Essence Festival. \"And I do believe that there is a national movement afoot to attack hard won and hard fought freedoms.\"\n\nThe annual music festival engages Black and African American women focusing on culture, empowerment and societal issues. This year many of the conversations were dominated by the decisions the Supreme Court had made in the hours before.\n\ntoggle caption Abdul Aziz for NPR\n\n\"I have three degrees. I come from a home where I did not have $500,000. I did not have parents paying for my education\" Tomayia Colvin of Houston said to NPR at the festival.

So I'm really interested to see what her thoughts are and how we can continue to cultivate and also support marginalized voices.\"\n\n\"I like her because I feel like she's getting out there,\" said Camille Hodges. Dwayne and Camille Hodges host a show in Davenport, Iowa, called Wake Up in Praise. \"She's not sitting behind a desk. She's getting out in the communities, and you know, finding out what's going on and meeting people and talking to them,\" said Camille Hodges. Her spouse believes Harris is starting to address various thorny issues, which impresses him. \"She's not shying away and not talking about them,\" said Dwayne Hodges.\n\ntoggle caption Abdul Aziz for NPR\n\nVanessa Rice is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority, like the vice president. Rice describes herself as an independent voter but said she leans conservative. While she supports the vice president, Rice said the Biden-Harris administration hasn't done enough for a population that put the two of them into office. \"It just seems like other groups' matters get handled faster than ours,\" she said.\n\nLast year at this time, the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade. Since then, Harris has taken on the task of addressing reproductive rights and maternal health care from her side of the political spectrum. As she has traveled the country, Harris said she's heard countless stories. \"The stories are, women having miscarriages in toilets. The stories are women who are in the process of a miscarriage, who are being denied care at an emergency room and going back to the emergency room and being denied again,\" Harris said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Abdul Aziz for NPR Abdul Aziz for NPR\n\nNPR's Michel Martin sat down with Vice President Harris in New Orleans after her appearance at Essence Fest to talk about her work, her thoughts on the high court's ruling and the 2024 election. This is an edited and condensed version of the interview.\n\nMichel Martin: Given that the range of action possible for the administration is fairly narrow in this area, one could make the argument that the administration has done what it can do through executive action; and, that also speaks to the question of the student loan debt issue. As we are speaking today, the president has spoken about this, back in Washington, and he's laid out what steps the administration's prepared to take. But, the range of things that you can do is fairly narrow. Given all that, what's your message?\n\nVice President Harris: Well, the message is, it's not a slogan. The message is, first on an issue like student loan debt \u2013 to first speak to the issue, itself and the importance of understanding the issue \u2013 which is so many of our young people, in particular, are experiencing debt that is out of proportion; that it is weighing them down to the extent that they are wondering if they can ever have a family, if they can ever buy a home. We are looking at a policy that we believe in; that if implemented, if the court hadn't acted as it did, would have meant that 90% of the recipients of student loan debt relief, make under $75,000 a year and are barely able to make it through the month with the other bills that they have. And so, we are going to be creative in the way that we can provide some relief to this population that we have front of mind on this issue.\n\nOn the issue of reproductive care and access to reproductive care \u2013 through not only the Department of Justice where litigation is happening, where it is appropriate \u2013 through Health and Human Services, what we are doing to make clear that no one should be denied access to emergency care \u2013 there is a law in that regard, and doing what we need to do to enforce that law, doing what we can and need to do to inform people of their privacy rights on an issue like abortion. So there is work that we can do. But ultimately, for a lot of these issues, look, we have three branches of government. The court took rights from the people of America. Congress can put those rights back in place. We cannot through executive action. Congress can. So part of the point, including when I was talking on the stage here in New Orleans, is reminding people of the power of their vote to elect people into the United States Congress who care about the importance of putting back in place in law the protections of Roe v. Wade.\n\ntoggle caption Abdul Aziz for NPR\n\nMartin: So your job in part, is to tell people you need to vote for Democrats, because Democrats will restore these rights, defend these rights, and will expand the range of options that are available to people in policy. That's basically, sort of the message. So here's my question...\n\nHarris: Well, no, but let me just say that it's because Democrats are the ones standing for these rights. So I'm saying, if you care about these rights, then these are the folks who are going to deliver them.\n\nMartin: The question I have for you, Madam Vice President, is, is that enough for you, for you, as a sort of a political actor to establish yourself in the minds of the American people as a credible successor, if need be, to President Biden. I mean, the fact is, it's not a secret \u2013 maybe it's hard to talk about \u2013 but the fact of the matter is the president's age puts you into play. The Republicans already sort of made it clear that's a topic for them; that that's an issue that they are going to fully exploit to the degree that they can. So, the question is your role big enough to establish you as a worthy successor to President Biden should the need arise.\n\nHarris: Right now, we are focused on doing everything we can, and we will continue to focus on doing everything we can to deliver for the American people, including we are running for reelection. The president is running for reelection as president, I am running for re-election with him as vice president. And that is my focus. I'm traveling around the country to make sure that people know not only what they have received because they stood in line for hours during the height of a pandemic in 2020 demanding these things. But also what is yet to come.\n\nAnd that includes what we will do to continue to fight, to make sure that people's freedoms and rights are protected. And we will do the work of continuing to deliver, whether it be continuing to bring down the cost of health care, as it relates to, for example, capping insulin at $35 a month for seniors, which we have done; people have demanded that for years. We have delivered over 13 million new jobs; we're going to continue to do that. We have dropped almost a trillion dollars over the next 10 years in a clean energy economy to finally address the climate crisis in a substantial way, and this is the work that we will continue to do.\n\nMartin: Before we let you go ... we talked to a number of people in the audience; they were glad to see. Some of them waited for quite some time to see you. For people who haven't had a chance to see you, is there something that you would wish them to know that they don't know?\n\nHarris: I love to cook!\n\nMartin: But you're in New Orleans, you don't have to cook.\n\nHarris: Oh, not but I'm actually going to be stopping by the butcher to get some andouille and some tasso on my way home!\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Abdul Aziz for NPR Abdul Aziz for NPR\n\nThe audio story was produced by Ben Abrams and edited by Reena Advani.

Her only daughter, Mariely, has a college degree in psychology but struggled to find a job after graduating in Honduras. She migrated to Florida 3 years ago.\n\n\"It's hard and it's a contradiction,\" Trejo says. \"How do I tell people not to migrate when my daughter is there?\" she asked.\n\nAt the same time, migrants are a key economic engine in Honduras: Remittances make up more than a quarter of the country's GDP, according to the World Bank, the highest rate in the western hemisphere.\n\nLoading...\n\n'I'm here to ask for your help'\n\nLast spring, Trejo decided to tap into the diaspora of former Macuelizans who had move to the U.S. In Charlottesville, Virginia, she made an appearance at a Honduran restaurant called El Ciruelo, named after a small community in Macuelizo that has seen hundreds of residents leave for the U.S.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joel Rose/NPR Joel Rose/NPR\n\nTrejo is welcomed like a celebrity by dozens of Honduran expats. The restaurant's owner Bertha Alicia Ramos thanked Trejo for visiting and \"for not forgetting us,\" she says. \"El Ciruelo, Macuelizo, is where we come from, even though we don't live there anymore, but we are always present in spirit.\" The crowd claps enthusiastically.\n\nWearing a white dress and black stilettos, 53-year-old Trejo takes the microphone.\n\n\"Good afternoon, friends, comrades, countrymen and women, fighters, all of you,\" says Trejo while attendees eat baleadas, a favorite street food in Honduras made from layers of refried beans, cheese and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in a thick homemade tortilla.\n\n\"Now that I'm your mayor,\" says Trejo, \"I'm here to ask for your help and to listen to your ideas so we can better the quality of life for people in Macuelizo, especially our young people.\"\n\nShe tells the crowd that she knows someday they'll want to go back and reunite with friends and family, walk the streets they walked as children. \"I know you don't forget your people and you'd want to work to improve your community,\" she says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tomas Ayuso for NPR Tomas Ayuso for NPR\n\n\"I'm here with a proposal,\" she says. \"I want to give kids music lessons in schools.\" Trejo, who worked as a school teacher for 30 years, says that music can inspire change. \"I'm asking you to donate a dollar or two to hire music teachers and buy a marimba and guitars.\"\n\nTrejo says she sees music as a tool to stop migration, to instill pride in kids and perhaps keep them in Macuelizo. While at the same time, there's irony in her visiting the diaspora community, people who left Honduras looking for opportunity, to seek their help.\n\n\"I also want to set up other programs to improve education and health,\" she says with a big smile, looking people in the eye. \"Having a good education system is the best way to free people from manipulation, violence and ignorance.\"\n\ntoggle caption Tomas Ayuso for NPR\n\nBefore Charlottesville, Trejo visited two other U.S. cities. \"In Miami we were able to fundraise to buy 30 guitars!,\" she says with excitement in her voice. \"In Houston we managed to get funds for 18 guitars! So we are here to ask you: how many guitars will you contribute for Macuelizo?\" She tells the crowd her government will write the name of the donor in the back of the guitar. \"We'll share pictures and videos when the kids play.\"\n\n\"I don't need to remind you of our needs,\" she adds.\n\nProblems are huge in Honduras\n\nHonduras has the highest teen pregnancy in Central America, according to the most recent Honduras Demographic and Health Survey.\n\nThe country has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, according to World Bank data. And the highest rate of femicide in Latin America.\n\nTrejo says most of Macuelizo residents work in subsistence agriculture, but they are not producing like before, she said, \"It's a shame,\" says Trejo, \"we have a lot of farmland, and yes lots of people own a small plot but they don't have the money to buy seeds or soil fertilizer.\"\n\n\"And now climate change has impacted these lands, we have a scarcity of water, and unpredictable weather patterns,\" she adds.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tomas Ayuso for NPR Tomas Ayuso for NPR\n\nSince the beginning of 2021, U.S. immigration authorities have encountered more migrants from Honduras at the southern border than any country except Mexico. Some of the reasons that they have left their homeland are familiar: violence, corruption and a lack of economic opportunity, exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nFor the last few years, climate change has become part of the reasons people are migrating, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency.\n\nTrejo pleads with the crowd: \"If we help farming families in Macuelizo, we would alter migration. And it's not that I see migration as a negative thing,\" she says, walking a fine line. \"Migrating is a human right.\" But we need to find ways to make a living in our own country, she says.\n\nAlready her government has set up a free afterschool lunch program \u2014 \"funded by two sons from Macuelizo in the U.S,\" she says. The crowd cheers.\n\nTrejo tells the crowd that she dreams of building gyms in Macuelizo's parks. \"Healthy body, healthy brain,\" she says. It's key to keep young people away from drugs and crime: \"Some weights, monkey bars, stairs,\" nothing fancy.\n\n\"You can be a model to other communities in Honduras,\" she tells the crowd. \"People would look at you and say: Look, the children of Macuelizo in the U.S. are funding these programs!\"\n\nTrejo then opens the floor to questions.\n\nDilcia Guardado raises her hand. She's also a former teacher and says that when she was in school she took a class on agricultural studies as did her students. She asks, \"Is that still the case? It's important because kids today don't want to work hard, they just want to be on their smartphones. What are teachers doing about this in Honduras today?\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tomas Ayuso for NPR Tomas Ayuso for NPR\n\n\"Gyms could work, but kids need to learn to work the land, to connect to the land,\" she says.\n\n\"That's an excellent observation,\" responds Trejo. \"That's why we are here, to hear your ideas.\" Several people say they'd support the music program. The group agrees to designate an organizing committee to fundraise and send the money to Honduras.\n\nThe mayor: a realist ... but also an optimist\n\nTrejo knows there are limits to what she can do to keep young people from leaving Honduras. When NPR reporters visited, she took them to a small village in Macuelizo called Colonia 6 de Mayo. A dozen kids were playing soccer in the afternoon sun while a group of young women watched from the side of the field.\n\nMar\u00eda del Carmen Caballero, 22, Leslie Tobillas, 19, and Mar\u00eda Sorto, 19, all live in Colonia 6 de Mayo. Asked about their future plans, the three friends respond in unison, \"we dream of migrating to the U.S.\" Their parents are farmers who rent land and struggle to grow beans and corn for subsistence.\n\ntoggle caption Tomas Ayuso for NPR\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't have any opportunities here,\" says Caballero.\n\n\"The truth is that I don't see a future for me here,\" says Tobillas, who is one of nine siblings. She says that having an education doesn't guarantee you a job in Honduras. She knows too many graduates who are struggling to find work. She said she has many friends already in the U.S. working and sending money back home. They tell her she could do the same.\n\n\"All I want is to work to help my parents buy a home \u2014 that's my hope,\" Tobillas says in a whisper.\n\nWhen reporters ask Trejo what her government can do to offer these young people more opportunities in Macuelizo, she struggles as she gives an honest answer. \"To say that as a mayor I can offer them employment opportunities so they don't migrate, so they stay in their communities \u2013 no, I can't do that,\" she says.\n\nBut Trejo does have something to show for her efforts. She says the guitar project has been a success. \"We made it!,\" she declares jubilantly. \"We have 80 guitars and kids learning to play, and we have more kids who are interested.\" The children, between 9- and 12-years-old, are learning to play Honduran and Latin American songs.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mayor Jacqueline Trejo Mayor Jacqueline Trejo\n\nTrejo was optimistic when she made the plan to tap the diaspora community in the U.S., she says. But she also felt it was something of a gamble when she appealed to Macuelizans living in the U.S.\n\n\"In a way, they know that by giving money to buy guitars, they are present,\" she says. \"They are seeking connection.\" Trejo says many migrants in the U.S. can't go back home to visit because they don't have documents.\n\nTrejo hopes that by strengthening social and cultural connections for young people, they may think twice about migrating: \"They'll feel rooted.\"",

            "text": "Despite its name, the Inflation Reduction Act isn't just about taming rising prices. Signed by President Joe Biden in August 2022, the historic package is also the most significant piece of climate legislation in US history, providing nearly $369 billion in tax credits and other incentives for Americans who invest in renewables and energy-efficient home improvements over the next decade.\n\nBut, according to a new report, most Americans don't know about these lucrative offerings and still think installing solar panels is out of their reach.\n\nRead on: How the Inflation Reduction Act Will Fight Climate Change\n\nIn a survey sponsored by SunPower, a leading US solar installer, a quarter of respondents said they'd never heard of the law.\n\nCan solar panels save you money? Interested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we\u2019ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.\n\nOf those who had, more than half (51%) didn't know it included energy-related tax breaks.\n\nOne of the biggest environmental wins in the landmark legislation was the extension of the federal solar tax credit, which allows taxpayers to deduct a chunk of the cost of installing solar panels.\n\nIt was slated to expire in 2024, but thanks to the IRA, not only has the credit been extended for a decade, it's also increased from 26% to 30% through 2032.\n\nThe White House says, thanks to the expanded credit, 7.5 million more families will be able to install rooftop solar panels.\n\nThe good news is that most people understand the financial benefits of solar, said Suzanne Leta, SunPower's head of policy and strategy. Some 78% of those surveyed believed it would trim their monthly electricity bill.\n\n\"The uphill challenge will be showing these Americans that they can access those benefits, regardless of their income level,\" Leta said in a statement.\n\nMany Americans think solar power is \"only for the wealthy,\" she added, or that lower- to moderate-income Americans don't qualify for tax breaks from renewables.\n\nIn the SunPower survey, 39% of respondents didn't think they were eligible.\n\nWomen, younger Americans and lower- to middle-income earners in particular were less familiar with the IRA's energy-reducing incentives, according to the survey data.\n\nPrevious polling has found 70% of Gen Zers (those born between 1997 to 2012) say they'd go over budget for a house with solar panels or other green upgrades. But only a third of the Gen Zers in SunPower's study even knew about the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThat's bad, especially since the incentives won't be around forever.\n\n\"The most urgent action is to ramp up our education efforts,\" Leta said. \"It's critical that we tackle misconceptions while driving home that the IRA benefits can apply to all Americans.\"\n\nCurious about saving on solar? Discover all the energy-efficient rebates and tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, get the download on state-level incentives and calculate how long it will take for your solar setup to pay for itself.",

            "publish_date": "2023-10-27T00:00:00",
            "text": "The use of renewable fuels in producing electricity is considered as a fundamental step to decarbonise the electricity sector which provides an effective strategy to combat the climate change. Thus, this thesis examines the determinants of the non-hydro renewable technology (NHRE), investigates the potential future adoption of the NHRE and quantifies the amount of hydrogen storage which has been established as an appropriate technology to store wind electricity, required to address the excess wastes from high wind deployment. Specifically, the empirical issues addressed are: (i) to extent the configuration of the existing conventional electricity sources influences the NHRE deployment, (ii) the role of environmental policy (such as Kyoto Protocol and Feed-in-Tariffs) and natural gas profitability to ensure better comparisons with related previous research in the deployment, and (iii) the likely potential estimate bias from assuming constant effects of the deployment determinants across the OECD countries, and from not adequately addressing the endogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. The simulation chapters examine the following issues: (i) the extent to which price dynamics influence the low-carbon investment decisions in the UK electricity system, while considering the market and policy uncertainties (ii) the amount of hydrogen storage required at utility-scale level to mitigate the excess wind electricity waste, and (iii) the investment returns of deploying the hydrogen storage technology towards the UK net zero electricity transition.\n\nThe thesis commences with Chapter 2 that provides an empirical analysis of the factors underlying the observed variations in the deployment of the non-hydro renewable electricity (NHRE) generation across 35 OECD countries between 1980 and 2014. The chapter first applies the fixed-effect estimation technique to test the strong assumption of a constant elasticity of GDP, population and CO 2 emissions made in the static fixed effect literature, while allowing for additional control variables not previously considered. Then, it applies the system GMM to the dynamic panel model settings which are required, after subjecting its datasets to the panel unit root and cointegration tests. The findings from the study\u2019s panel estimation techniques reinforce the homogenous elasticity assumption in the existing cross-country studies of the non-hydro renewable deployment as the interaction terms are not statistically significant. While addressing the endogeneity and the cross-sectional dependence in the dynamic system GMM models, the study finds that only GDP is the main driver of the non-hydro renewable electricity deployment. In addition, the significance influence associated with population and CO 2 emissions in the literature, turns to be insignificant when including the configuration of the existing conventional electricity system, the climate policy variables, and the share of natural gas rents in GDP as additional control variables. Furthermore, the system GMM results reveal that the nuclear electricity share and the potential gas electricity generation significantly influence the NHRE deployment in an opposite manner, while Feed-in tariffs (which is only considered as the related literature did for a better comparison) stimulates more uptake of the non-hydro renewable electricity. No direct effect is from signing the Kyoto treaty and the onset of its binding which might be due to bottlenecks and the capacity constraints or policy inertia but more deployment of the NHRE is observed in the later period of its binding. The research finds less deployment of the new renewable energy sources as the share of natural gas rents in GDP increases. Considering these findings, the chapter suggests that any policy that improves the economic conditions, would induce the deployment of the non-hydro renewable electricity, even with less attention on the population and the CO 2 emissions.\n\nThe first simulation chapter, Chapter 3, develops a novel agent-based model at the power plant level using the UK real electricity grid information, to incorporate a profitability value as an additional attribute for each power plant. Then, the study examines the impact of these power plants\u2019 attributes on the low-carbon investment decision under the marginal and dual pricing methods in the context of the UK electricity system. The key findings from the developed agent-based model reveal that the role of nuclear technology towards the UK electricity decarbonisation drops to 5% at 2050, but the wind electricity share attains almost 50%, with an increase in the share of gas technology under the dual pricing system. The installed capacities of the low-carbon technologies especially nuclear and wind exhibit different penetration patterns, the wind installed capacity accounts for more than 40 GW in 2050 in a new pricing regime, while the installed capacity of nuclear technology which is used as baseload plant drop to 1.2 GW. In the same vein, evidence of more capital investments is attributed to wind and gas technologies with \u00a345 billion for wind technology in 2050, suggesting that the intermittent wind technology takes significant proportion of the electricity investment under the dual pricing regime as the wind technology receives more capital investments while the baseload nuclear technology witnesses capital disinvestments. However, the new pricing regime reduces the amount of the 2021 CO 2 emission level in the UK electricity generation system by 55% at 2050, compared to 80% reduction in the marginal pricing system.\n\nThe second simulation chapter, Chapter 4, extends the built agent-based model to quantify the amount of the hydrogen storage required to reduce the excess wind electricity waste in the UK electricity system. Furthermore, the chapter provides the economic evaluation of the hydrogen storage investment using the discounted cashflow method that allows for both market and policy uncertainties. By implementing these techniques, the chapter finds that the required hydrogen capacity increases more in the next 20 years when varying both carbon price and electricity price, compared to the fixed price case. Additionally, the minimum amount of hydrogen capacity to resolve this excess electricity waste, is above 2,000 MW with the associated investment cost of not less than \u00a3800 million. However, a significant reduction in the hydrogen capital cost decreases the investment cost of the hydrogen capacity, while more investment returns occur as the hydrogen lifespan increases. This indicates a trade-off between the hydrogen capital cost reduction and the lifespan expansion. In all the cases, the investment returns remain positive and robust, thus, suggesting that adequate and appropriate government incentives are needed to encourage private investment in the utility-scale hydrogen storage technology, which is economically viable, environmentally friendly, and socially worthwhile towards the UK net-zero targets. Also, the hydrogen policy needs to pay more attention on ensuring an optimal balance between the hydrogen capital cost reduction and the improved lifespan as both could influence the pace of the hydrogen storage investment in the UK electricity grid.",

            "text": "Health professionals occupy road with \u2018die-in\u2019 and issue demands to Oil & Money summit delegates\n\nOver 60 health professionals joined hundreds of protesters this morning outside the Energy Intelligence forum risking arrest by holding a \u2018die-in\u2019 and \u2018climate inquest\u2019 in the middle of the road outside the conference centre. The recently rebranded \u2018Oil and Money\u2019 conference is the largest annual gathering of oil companies and their backers.\n\nThe Health for Extinction Rebellion members also delivered an open letter to the conference organisers and delegates, calling them out for their central role in the climate crisis, and demanding immediate mitigating actions. \u201cWe wish to make it clear that we understand and condemn the continuing deliberate complicity of the energy sector in this humanitarian disaster,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe physicians, surgeons, GPs, nurses, physiotherapists and psychologists traveled from across the UK for today\u2019s action. 14 of them lay themselves, shrouded, in military hospital style. Other health professionals circled amongst them, tending their \u2018fallen\u2019 colleagues, and laying headstones indicating the climate health impact each represented. A mock inquest was then held, in which health-workers gave testimony on the deaths already caused by the planetary emergency. These included among others, the 6 million deaths every year resulting from air pollution (Fuller, 2020), the 5 million deaths globally each year from extreme temperatures (Zhoa. 2021), and the 43,000 who died from the climate-change associated drought and famine in Somalia last year (WHO/Unicef, 2021).\n\nAt the conference, leaders from companies such as Equinor (the company responsible for developing the proposed UK Rosebank oil-field), Shell and Total will be schmoozing together and planning yet more fossil fuel extraction, while telling the world they are committed to a green energy transition.\n\nNew extraction goes against the explicit warning of the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2021) and the United Nations (UN news, 2022), yet politicians, lawyers and financiers continue to support a fossil fuel industry that has known for decades that fossil fuels cause deadly global warming (Scientific American, 2015). To emphasize this complicity, health workers today also held \u2018Cigarette-style\u2019 Health warnings, and a Banner reading \u2018Fossil Fuels Kill\u2019. The action sought to draw a direct parallel with the Tobacco industry which was complicit in 100,000\u2019s if not millions of deaths, by knowingly misleading the public around the health impacts of smoking.\n\nDespite the bleak reality of the climate crisis, the action also emphasized the numerous potential benefits for human health of climate action (The Health Foundation, 2023), and the need to galvanize mass support for the appropriate action needed to safeguard a healthy future.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of actions by Health for Extinction Rebellion highlighting the health impacts of the financial and political decisions that are driving the climate and ecological emergency.\n\nQuotes from participating Health workers:\n\n\u201cDuring the August heatwave of 2022 my father suffered a heart attack and died the following week. He had chronic physical health problems and like many of the most vulnerable in our society could not manage the extreme heat that climate change is bringing to us. This is not a problem of the future. It is a health catastrophe that we are living through right now\u201d. Dr Jethro Purkis Specialty Doctor Bristol\n\n\u201cGovernments and companies that continue to finance and license new coal, oil and gas are doing so at the expense of their citizens. Fossil fuels are the drivers of deadly climate change and air pollution in our communities. This is an industry that has delayed and denied climate change for decades in the name of greed, putting profit above all else, and from a health and a moral perspective it\u2019s beyond time to shut it down\u201d Dr Juliette Brown, Consultant Psychiatrist\n\n\u201cI am here demonstrating for my pregnant patients, for the new mums and for their babies that I see on a daily basis, I am also here for my own children to say that the fossil fuel companies are destroying any chance of our children being able to live any sort of \u201cnormal\u201d future. That the burning of fossil fuels have caused irreversible damage to our planet and that we need companies to stop all new fossil fuel exploration and to start being world leaders in green energy. It is possible, we just need them to start putting the planet and people before profit\u201d. Charlotte Francis. Perinatal Pelvic Health Specialist Physiotherapist\n\n\u201cI am a retired GP and to my last breath I will endeavour to spread the scientific truths which the powers-that-be try so desperately to conceal from the public. I will always denounce the greed and self-interest borne of their grotesque worship of money which has clearly eaten away at their consciences, even their very humanity, to the extent that they are apparently unable to relate to the enormous suffering already in the southern hemisphere, let alone envisage the horrors ahead if they continue their love-affair with Fossil Fuels\u201d.

            "text": "In 2004, two seminal papers were published [1, 2] describing a new and revolutionary way to make materials, different from the way they have been made over many previous millenia, ever since human evolution started at the beginning of the last ice age about 3 million years ago.\n\nAll human development has been driven by the discovery and use of new materials, and all materials are alloys, i.e. mixtures of starting materials (or components): beginning with the cleaved silica flint tools used during the stone age for hunting animals and cutting down plants when humans first emerged as the weather deteriorated at the onset of the ice age; to the alumino-silicate clay pots for storing food during the agricultural revolution that ushered in settled farming communities as the weather improved and the ice age came to an end almost three million years later (some 12,000 years ago); to the smelted cast and wrought copper-tin and iron-carbon alloys that led to the growth of cities, trade, governments and empires, beginning at about 4000 BC as bronze-age and iron-age civilisations such as the Pharoahs in Egypt, the Qin dynasty in China and the Roman Empire sprang up worldwide; to the mass-produced low-carbon and alloy steels used for the precision machinery, manufacturing equipment and industrial plant, and the large-scale bridges, skyscrapers, ships, trains and automobiles of the late industrial revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that took (and continues to take) millions of people out of near-starvation farming into comfortable middle-class living; to the high-strength, high-temperature nickel superalloys that power jet engines and launched mass intercontinental air transport as it developed through the middle of the twentieth century; to the microalloyed (doped) silicon, germanium and compound semiconductors used for the billions of transistors that drive the computers and telecommunications equipment and the internet and artificial-intelligence capabilities of our knowledge economies in the current information revolution; to the mono- and poly-silicon photovoltaic cells in vast solar arrays and the complex intercalated lithium materials in high-energy, high-intensity batteries, all needed to prevent excessive greenhouse gas emissions and undesirable climate change in the current green energy revolution; and so on [3, 4].\n\nHowever, all these wonderful materials and technologies that have been employed to date have been developed using a simple but severely limited (as we now know) conventional alloying strategy, with a primary material selected for the main property requirement of the product being manufactured, and with small amounts of just a few, often no more than one or two, dilute alloying additions to tweak the material and product performance and impart any necessary secondary properties. This conventional alloying strategy was not developed consciously, but grew progressively over past decades and centuries to become a kind of standard practice, informed by an unspoken received wisdom that increasing alloying element numbers and/or concentrations makes materials difficult to manufacture satisfactorily due to the associated formation of increased and then excessive amounts of brittle binary and ternary compounds.\n\nBut believing in received wisdom is always dangerous in science. The sun does not go round the earth: the earth is not flat; the measured speed of light is the same no matter how fast you run towards or away from it; phlogiston is not produced when materials burn; apparently solid materials are mostly composed of space between somewhat evanescent, wavelike protons, neutrons and electrons; complex living organisms develop by serendipitous random mutation; and (in respect of our current concern) high levels of alloying turn out to be less problematic than had always seemed to be the case. A completely different, indeed a revolutionary new alloying strategy began to be explored in early experiments by Cantor and his colleagues in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and independently by Yeh and his colleagues in the mid-1990s, culminating with the parallel publication, as mentioned above, of seminal papers [1, 2] from both groups in 2004 (though the basic concept had in fact been published previously, albeit briefly, by both groups [5,6,7,8,9]). The novel idea that both groups began to explore was to make materials by alloying with larger numbers of components in larger concentrations, and they both almost immediately made some surprising (though in retrospect perhaps now obvious) discoveries: first that the high configurational entropy from using more components in greater proportions tends to suppress compound formation and thus tends to stabilise multicomponent single-phase solid solutions of existing close-packed or simple compound crystal structures; and second, that making high concentration, multicomponent materials is, as a consequence, often much easier than previously expected, since in many cases it does not after all produce the continued formation of more and more multiple brittle compounds leading to brittle failure during manufacture. Effectively these discoveries massively expanded at a stroke the number of materials available to us all for investigation and subsequent potential application for the benefit of humankind, and led to the rapid and mushrooming growth of an enormous new field, now usually known as high-entropy alloys or high-entropy materials, (though also sometimes called multicomponent alloys or materials, complex-concentrated alloys or materials, or multiple-principal-element alloys or materials, in order to emphasise when needed the multiplicity and high concentration of the components rather than the associated high configurational entropy).\n\nThe two seminal papers of 2004 garnered no more than a handful of citations in the immediate following few years, but the scientific establishment gradually woke up to the tremendous potential for discovering exciting new material structures, properties, phenomena and applications, and the field took off through the 2010s and early 2020s, with major research programmes now underway in many countries and thousands of papers being published every year. A couple of years ago, one of us (Ian Baker) pointed out to the other two (Brian Cantor and Jien-Wei Yeh) that current publications in this new field are distributed widely over an eclectic range of research journals, and suggested that it would be desirable and appropriate for the field, given its current level of maturity, to have a single focal point for reporting key discoveries and exchanging emerging ideas. We consulted with many other scientists working in the field, who were all uniformly enthusiastic about the idea, so we put together a proposal to Anita Lekhwani. Executive Publisher at Springer Nature. She led the project through to approval by Springer Nature\u2019s executive board, where it underwent a rigorous approval process and was enthusiastically endorsed. The beginning of last year, January 2022, marked the official launch of the resulting new journal, High Entropy Alloys and Materials, with the three of us (Ian Baker, Brian Cantor and Jien-Wei Yeh), all early practitioners in the field [1, 2, 10], acting as joint Chief Editors, and with four other scientific colleagues (Isaac Chang, Michael Gao, Jian Luo and An-Chou Yeh) acting as Associate Editors. We were pleased to get further support from many of the senior scientists with whom we had consulted, who also agreed to join the new journal\u2019s Editorial Advisory Board and provide a continuing source of help and advice. We decided at the outset to apply high publication standards, and we have been fortunate to receive some excellent submitted manuscripts that have now been published. After just over a year of operations, we are now compiling the first issue of the new journal, which we believe marks a key milestone in the development of the whole field.\n\nMajor discoveries in the last decade or two of intensive research into high-entropy alloys and materials include the following: the demonstration of the importance of high configurational entropy in stabilising single phases in multicomponent materials [1]; the discovery of the first high-entropy single-phase fcc alloy CrMnFeCoNi, now known as the original Cantor alloy, at the centre of a massive single-phase fcc region in multicomponent phase space [2]; the discovery of a similar high-entropy single-phase bcc alloy VNbMoTaW, now known as the original Senkov alloy, at the centre of a similarly massive single-phase bcc region in multicomponent phase space [11]; the discovery of a high-entropy single-phase rock-salt-structured mono-oxide (MgCoNiCuZn)O, again at the centre of a massive single-phase rock salt-structured mono-oxide region in multicomponent phase space [12]; similar multicomponent high-entropy single-phase regions for many other well-known binary and ternary intermetallic, ionic and ceramic compounds [13,14,15]; the outstanding ductility and fracture toughness of the fcc Cantor alloys [16, 17]; the outstanding high-temperature strength of the bcc Senkov alloys [18, 19]; the sluggish diffusion in multicomponent high-entropy materials, making them resistant to degradation by corrosion and irradiation [20,21,22]; the enormous potential for tuning the functional properties of multicomponent high-entropy ceramic compounds by varying and optimising their composition [13,14,15]; and the demonstration of the underlying enormity of multicomponent phase space, with literally trillions upon trillions of new materials yet to be thought of or discovered, let alone investigated [23,24,25]. The field of high-entropy alloys and materials is truly gigantic, with lots of wonderful new materials to be found, and lots of new material behaviours to be investigated and understood.\n\nDetailed experimental studies and detailed theories of many phenomena in high-entropy materials and alloys remain to be fully explored, including segregation during solidification, vapour-deposition dynamics, point-defect structures, multicomponent interdiffusion, short-range ordering and clustering, recrystallisation and texture development, grain-boundary structure and properties; fatigue and creep, interstitial embrittlement, electrical and magnetic properties, wear resistance, welding and joining, irradiation effects, and so on. Some of these have hardly been studied at all, and others have begun to be studied but are still far from any complete understanding. In general, high-entropy alloys and materials exhibit behaviours with some similarities to pure materials and simple binary mixtures, but with surprising differences and corresponding complexities. Human socio-economic conditions have always been driven by the discovery and implementation of new (conventionally) alloyed materials, and the field of high-entropy alloys and materials now provides a vast new palette of materials for our collective future. There are many new discoveries to be made and many new theories to be developed, and we look forward to reporting many of them in the future pages of our new \u201chouse\u201d journal High Entropy Alloys and Materials. We hope you enjoy this first volume, and we hope you will submit your future manuscripts to the new journal to continue and to enhance its initial success.\n\nIan Baker, Brian Cantor and Jien-Wei Yeh\n\nChief Editors of High Entropy Alloys and Materials",

            "text": "Today, the world is well aware of climate change and is taking efficient measures to control it. Due to the increase in global greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and other environmental contamination sources, a dramatic downturn could be faced in the future (Etokakpan 2019; Manisalidis et al. 2020). The world will face the challenge of the same pace of black footprint in the coming decades due to the incremental effect of environmental gases, especially carbon emissions. By 2050, \u201cnet zero emission\u201d should be achieved to avoid climate calamity because, up to the end of this twenty-first century, the global economy can only emit approximately 700 gigatons of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) (Barhorst 2016). With time, the need for a sustainable global energy system becomes a significant concern and policy objective. However, this is associated with a long-term process involving an enormous transformation of the current energy structure (Aziz et al. 2023).\n\nEnvironmental organizations and scientists have worked tirelessly to raise awareness of global warming over the past few decades. However, the evidence shows that the threat to the environment and climate is only getting worse and is becoming a huge concern (Alola et al. 2019; Bekun et al. 2019; Saint Akadiri et al. 2019). A significant element of environmental gases is carbon emission, which has increased by 6% in 2021 from 2020 (the highest ever annual increase) and pushed global emissions to 36.3 gigatons, as reported by the International Energy Agency (IEA 2021).\n\nAustralia\u2019s domestic electricity generation depends on coal (Boretti 2020), one of the leading causes of environmental degradation. Moreover, the depletion of resources is threatening the countries to find alternative resources for the energy generation mechanism (Bahadori and Nwaoha 2013). Australia was ranked as the top global GHG per capita emitter due to generating electricity by coal (42.7% black and 20.2% brown coal) (Hua et al. 2016). Australia is the largest in the Asia-Pacific and the third-largest country globally, which owns 150 billion tons of proven coal reserves, as reported in the BP Statistical Review 2021 (Kar et al. 2022). The new climate and energy framework implemented by the European Union (EU) urges countries to generate and consume 27% of energy from renewable sources by the end of 2030 to reduce annual global GHG emissions to a maximum of 27.4 GtCO2eq per year (European Commission 2018). Instead of compliance with this EU framework 2030, the analysis described that only 6% of energy consumption is generated from renewable sources from Australia, pointing out the high dependency on fossil fuels (DEE 2018). Some of the prime objectives of energy policymakers are to establish economic incentives for green energy sources, support research and development, and implement other policies and initiatives to boost the amount of environmentally friendly energy in national energy mixes. However, several countries and organizations have already commenced along the route to a sufficient energy transformation (Shafiei et al. 2017), such as shifting towards hydrogen energy.\n\nResearchers and decision-makers are looking to pursue the usage of hydrogen as a potentially game-changing solution (Dutta 2014). Hydrogen is considered the fuel of the future due to its purity and the most prevalent substance in the universe (Barhorst 2016). In addition, unlike electricity, hydrogen can be captured and stored easily (Antonini et al. 2020). Hydrogen has proven to be a \u201cmissing link\u201d between carbon emission and zero emission that may provide renewable energy to multiple sectors in high volumes for decarbonizing industry, electricity generation, transportation, and using natural gas. Hydrogen primarily produced from fuel-based scheme results in gray H2 that emits high carbon (Eljack and Kazi 2021).\n\nOn the contrary, in the processing of blue H2, the carbon is stored or reused (Fig. 1). Green H2 is a carbon-neutral energy source (Dong et al. 2022). However, its production cost is much higher than blue and gray H2.\n\nHowever, the production of green hydrogen has been increasing in recent eras (Raman et al. 2022) to decarbonize the economy because countries have immense pressure to adopt green environmental policies (Baah et al. 2021). Major exporter countries of energy and fossil fuel, including Australia, aimed to adopt net zero emission goals in the Conference of the Parties (COP26) by promoting the projects of clean hydrogen. Experts foresee Australia as an emerging market for clean and green hydrogen producers by 2050 (Pflugmann and De Blasio 2020; Schreyer et al. 2020). An increase in renewable energy production will significantly benefit Australia\u2019s green environment. Specifically, it will improve the country\u2019s ability to produce clean hydrogen (Kar et al. 2022), which also helps to reduce urban-based emissions by managing the heated and chilling systems of buildings (Gao et al. 2017). As a safe, reliable, and potentially sustainable fuel, hydrogen is increasingly involved in energy carriers to boost the economy\u2019s and society\u2019s global sustainable development (Falcone et al. 2021). In its new role, hydrogen is a game changer and significantly supports reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nEven though there has been extensive research on the connections between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Ali et al. 2019; Cowan et al. 2014; Musa et al. 2018; Salahuddin et al. 2019), the usage of green energy (Wang et al. 2022a; Wang et al. 2022b; Yusaf et al. 2011), and economic growth (Alola et al. 2019; Bekun et al. 2019; Destek and Ozsoy 2016; Wang et al. 2022a; Wang et al. 2022b; Yusaf et al. 2011) for several years, the topic is still regarded as a significant policy discussion globally. GHG has a variety of negative consequences on both the economy and the sustainability of the environment (Etokakpan 2019). Environmental gases are growing because human activities and energy usage are growing exponentially, along with the economy, population, and trade (Rahman and Vu 2020). The world\u2019s economic growth is at risk due to rising energy utilization and the exhaustion of fossil fuel reserves (Chiari and Zecca 2011). Additionally, these fuels are not ecologically friendly because they generate GHG and other contaminants that significantly contribute to environmental degradation (Rusman and Dahari 2016; Sun et al. 2018). Starting in the twenty-first century, the European Commission (EC) recognized the necessity of constructing an efficient plan for transitioning to a hydrogen-oriented energy system in the direction of 2050, with a snapshot aimed at 2020 to spur economic growth (Cuevas et al. 2021). The current political, economic, and environmental conditions favor hydrogen technology, and the ideological underpinnings of government policy are clear in claims that hydrogen represents the Australian hope for economic development (Milani et al. 2020).\n\nAustralia possesses the expertise to create a domestic and international hydrogen market that is both commercially viable and capable of meeting emission reduction goals and resolving issues with energy security. However, despite the availability of numerous renewable sources, just 17% of Australia\u2019s overall energy consumption in 2018 was provided by renewable energy sources (Energy Council 2018). Methods for producing hydrogen would also be influenced by the available infrastructure, the technology\u2019s level of development, its effectiveness, where the resources are located, and how profitable local or international trading will be. It is conceivable that a range of paths, such as production, transport, storage, and utilization, may be used in a vast country like Australia, which has diverse resources, weather, and transportation alternatives (Milani et al. 2020). Australia\u2019s alternatives for practical and affordable integration may enable commercialized hydrogen production for the national and global markets.\n\nWhile reviewing the existing solutions, it is evident that most of these solution-based studies have provided a theoretically-based review. On the contrary, the current work aims to examine the empirical research findings on hydrogen usage concerning the broader picture of its environmental impact. Hence, the present study provides a few contributions to the existing literature in the following aspects: firstly, as per our limited knowledge, numerous researchers discussed the policy, properties, production, storage, and geographical overview of hydrogen (Barhorst 2016; Barreto et al. 2003; Dicks et al. 2004; Falcone et al. 2021; Sharma et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2019). In this regard, hydrogen\u2019s potential as a sustainable energy carrier has been intricately analyzed in various contexts. Barhorst (2016) delved into the concept of green hydrogen, highlighting its environmental benefits. Barreto et al. (2003) proposed a sustainable development scenario emphasizing the pivotal role of hydrogen in the twenty-first century economy. Dicks et al. (2004) critically examine the intersection of fuel cells, hydrogen, and Australia\u2019s energy landscape. Falcone et al. (2021) linked the hydrogen economy with sustainable development goals, offering policy insights. Sharma et al. (2021) underscored the dual economic and environmental merits of hydrogen as a fuel. But the empirical analysis of hydrogen firms was rarely done, which is an essential factor but is missing in the existing literature. This analysis evaluates the measurements taken to curtail environmental emissions by using the hydrogen factor while keeping in mind net zero emission. Secondly, this is the first study that discussed hydrogen utilization by hydrogen firms in Australia. Previously, studies used hydrogen utilization in different contexts. In their seminal study, Eichman et al. (2015) quantitatively evaluated the market dynamics of hydrogen, examining its direct correlation with renewable integration. Similarly, Brandon and Kurban (2017) utilized hydrogen as a metric to assess the overall efficiency of fuel cell systems. In a distinctive approach, Thompson et al. (2018) investigated the sociopolitical factors influencing hydrogen deployment, using its utilization rates as a dependent variable. Thirdly, we use quantile on quantile regression, which is helpful to re-examine the influence of hydrogen on the green environmental index. Although hydrogen\u2019s role in promoting a green environment has been increasingly recognized in academic research, Andrews and Shabani (2014) emphasized the significance of hydrogen in reducing greenhouse gas emissions when produced from renewable sources. In a pivotal study, Holladay et al. (2009) elucidated the synergistic relationship between hydrogen-based systems and reduced environmental footprints, underscoring their capacity for carbon neutrality. Furthermore, Veziroglu and Macario (2011) explored the impact of hydrogen-fueled vehicles in mitigating urban air pollutants, highlighting their potential for cleaner urban environments. However, none of the studies used quantile regression. Fourthly, one of the critical contributions of this work is to offer insights into the planning of hydrogen utilization systems through understanding that only \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201crenewable\u201d hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources can succeed in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nGiven the articulated contributions, the objectives for the study can be structured as follows:\n\nEmpirical evaluation of hydrogen firms: To empirically analyze the environmental mitigation strategies employed by hydrogen firms, explicitly focusing on reducing emissions by incorporating hydrogen in alignment with net zero emission targets.\n\nContextual examination of hydrogen utilization: To undertake a detailed investigation of hydrogen utilization by hydrogen firms within the Australian context, contrasting with prior studies that have interpreted hydrogen usage in diverse frames of reference.\n\nMethodological refinement: To employ the quantile-on-quantile regression technique to re-assess the influence of hydrogen on the green environmental index, thereby providing a nuanced statistical perspective not explored in prior studies.\n\nFocus on renewable hydrogen: To elucidate the significance of exclusively using \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201crenewable\u201d hydrogen\u2014produced through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources\u2014in the quest to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe remaining sections of this study are as follows: \u201cLiterature review\u201d section explains theoretical evidence, the literature review, and the development of hypotheses. \u201cData and methodology\u201d section consists of the development of critical constructs along with a discussion of the techniques used to collect and aggregate the data. \u201cResults\u201d examines the empirical findings and thoroughly checks for exogenous variables. \u201cConclusion and policy implications\u201d summarizes the results, describes the contributions, points out limitations, and provides helpful policy implications.",

            "text": "Climate change impacts human health, ecosystems and natural resources leading to global warming, extreme weather events, forced displacement, mental health pressures, air pollution, food and water insecurity, vector-borne diseases and biodiversity loss. Year 2022 was the sixth warmest year (all after 2010) on record based on NOAA\u2019s (The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) temperature data since 1880.1 To mitigate climate change impacts, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced and sustainable practices promoted, including energy conservation, renewable energy sources, eco-friendly transportation and agriculture and food systems.\n\nThe healthcare industry is responsible for approximately 4.4% of global net greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second largest emitter after the food sector.2 Emissions arise from energy use in healthcare facilities, patient and healthcare worker transportation, medical events and the production and disposal of medical equipment and biomedical waste.\n\nThe Indian Association of Dermatologists, Venereologists and Leprologists (IADVL), second largest professional organisation of dermatologists, represents dermatologists and skin care professionals in India. \u2018DERMACON\u2019, IADVL\u2019s annual conference gathers healthcare professionals, researchers and industry leaders to share knowledge and promote best practices in dermatology. However, like many large events, DERMACON has a significant environmental impact, generating waste, consuming energy and emitting greenhouse gases. As a responsible healthcare professional organisation, IADVL can lead in promoting sustainable practices and reducing DERMACON\u2019s environmental impact which can be then implemented in smaller national/ state conferences.\n\nBy implementing green practices, IADVLcan reduce the carbon footprint of DERMACON, save costs and promote sustainability among the delegates. One way to achieve this would be going paperless. Meaningful steps have already been taken in this direction with online registration, digital handouts, e-posters and promotion of digital communication and scientific programmes via a dedicated conference app. To enhance sustainability, we can use digital signage on large screens or projectors for schedules, announcements and directions instead of printed banners and posters. This reduces paper waste and resources used for printing, providing an interactive platform for attendees. Unnecessary conference mementoes, printed certificates and single-use decorations can be completely avoided. Instead of using disposable name badges, digital or reusable ones can be utilized. Banners, advertisements for seat covers and the serving of water and beverages should be done using recyclable or compostable materials. E-certificates for faculty and delegates can be given instead of printed material. An option may be given to delegates regarding the choice of conference bags which can be made from eco-friendly materials. Delegates not opting for bags may be offered discounted registration fees. In the conference halls, heating/cooling systems may be set to function only during occupancy hours.\n\nChoice of venue should preferably take into account the implementation of green practices by them, such as the use of energy-efficient lighting, renewable energy sources such as solar panels, water conservation measures like rainwater harvesting and green design featuring ample natural light and ventilation. Several venues in India offer green event options at present. To ensure that specific sustainability standards are met, green certifications like LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and IGBC (Indian Green Building Council) can be sought.3 By seeking out venues that have achieved these certifications, organizers can ensure that they are choosing a sustainable and environmentally responsible option.\n\nPromotion of sustainable transportation is another important measure that warrants consideration. The venue chosen should be centrally located and easily accessible by public transportation. Delegates should be encouraged to use public transportation and carpool. To promote eco-friendly transportation, the conference registration barcode can be utilised as a multifunctional pass for the entire event, mirroring the practices seen in numerous international conferences. Furthermore, complimentary shuttle bus services can be provided, operating at regular intervals between the conference venue and various hotels. Providing secure bike parking can encourage biking, reducing individual car trips and carbon emissions. A hybrid event can reduce the carbon footprint by limiting travel emissions and virtual attendee participation. Reducing the number of scientific and business meeting halls will have a positive impact on green DERMACON. The exhibition area and pharma industry stalls should also be promoted to all green-conference norms while performing their activities for obtaining stall footprints.\n\nAdditional measures that can be employed include sustainable catering and waste reduction. Caterers who use sustainable food practices such as locally sourced, organic and vegetarian or vegan options should be given preference. Getting delegates to pre-order their food during registration and avoiding individually wrapped food items are additional ways of reducing food-related waste. Reduced registration fees may be offered to delegates not opting for major meals (lunch/dinner). Issue of single-use plastic water bottles may be addressed by providing water-refilling stations, reusable/recyclable cups, or branded water bottles for future use. Recycling and composting bins should be provided throughout the venue. Finally, carbon offsetting programmes should be considered to mitigate the carbon emissions generated by the conference.4 This works by calculating emissions, and then investing in projects reducing an equivalent amount elsewhere. Examples include renewable energy (wind, solar, hydropower), forest conservation, reforestation and methane capture from landfills or livestock.\n\nThe medical community acknowledges the irony of conferences aimed at improving global health being responsible for global warming and as a result, many organisations have advocated for carbon-neutral conferences to be held.5 The American Medical Association aims to cut its carbon footprint by 50% by 2030 and the Royal College of Physicians in the UK aims for carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2018, the American Academy of Dermatology established an Expert Resource Group for climate change and healthcare. Mygreendoc.com offers a free online tool to calculate conference carbon footprints and suggests emission reduction actions. It\u2019s time for the IADVL to follow suit.\n\nNumerous sustainable practices can be applied in daily outpatient departments and clinics to lower their environmental impact. For instance, creating surgery sets with essential items only, offering smaller bandages/dressing materials, encouraging pharmaceutical representatives to use digital displays instead of printed hand-outs in consulting chambers and providing telemedicine consultations where possible. Hospital staff should receive training in proper waste disposal.\n\nIn conclusion, as we face the escalating impacts of climate change, it has become increasingly important for all sectors to act towards sustainable and environmentally responsible practices and promote a healthier planet for all. It is time for the medical community to step up and take action towards sustainability and DERMACON and IADVL can serve as a model for other medical associations to follow in India.",
